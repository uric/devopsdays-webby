## Propose a Talk!
        
<div><p style="font-size:large;">Deadline: Janurary 11, 2015</p></div>

### Steps
1. Create a proposal (see the Proposal Checklist below)
2. Email your proposal to [proposals-derby-2014@devopsdays.org](mailto:proposals-derby-2015@devopsdays.org)
3. Answer any clarifying questions (via email)
4. Get a notification whether your proposal was accepted

### Proposal Checklist
* Title
* Speaker name (optionally, company/position)
* Abstract
* Talk type (Ignite (5 min) or regular (30 min))
* Twitter handle (or public means of contact)
* Email (wonâ€™t be published, unless specified by you)
* Bio (max 200 words, we reserve the right to shorten it for publishing/layout reasons)

Besides the suggest a speaker/topic we also have the traditional ways to propose a session:

<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minute slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
</ol>

<h3>Speaker selection</h3>
The selection is done by the [complete organization team](../contact) over a discussion.
We take into account comments/remarks at the bottom of each proposal.
Once selection is complete, we will notify both selected and non selected speakers. 
Optionally we will tell people they are a runner up or ask them to propose the same subject as an Ignite talk.

<h3>Suggest a speaker, topic</h3>
Come on, don't be shy. We know you've always wanted a person to give their own view on a specific subject.
Now's your chance and we might make it happen.
