title: "Continuous Delivery - while converting from commercial to open source"
---

**Abstract:**

ThoughtWorks has recently converted it’s Go continuous delivery platform to an open source project. Making the change from a commercial project on an internal SCM system to an open source project on GitHub where anyone can make a pull request came with some interesting challenges. Since it wouldn't be OK for a continuous delivery product to not build continuously the normally accepted pattern of daily builds for open source would not be enough.

* How did we convert from an internal build grid with dozens of build agents to a system that the public can see? 
* Is trunk based development possible on this kind of project? 
* Who’s responsible for fixing automated tests (and does that responsibility change based on the type of test). 
* The volunteer developers don’t have massive build grids, how do we run thousands of automated tests?
* How much of the challenge is cultural and how much is technical?
