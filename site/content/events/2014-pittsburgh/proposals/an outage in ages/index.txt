title: "We havenâ€™t had an outage in ages - Lies, Damned Lies, and Outage Handling Best Practices from Real Customers"
---

**Abstract:**

Outages suck; how you handle them shouldn't. There are many aspects of an outage that go beyond just fixing the problem:

* During the incident: who to alert, how to communicate, handling dependency and downstream failures, public disclosure
* After the incident: post-mortems, public disclosure, formalizing process vs. investing in automation, preventative measures

There are also ways to keep engineers sane, customers happy, and the $$$ flowing.  In this talk, come learn about best practices from across the industry, including how PagerDuty executes during an outage (but trust us, those never happen).

**Speaker:**
