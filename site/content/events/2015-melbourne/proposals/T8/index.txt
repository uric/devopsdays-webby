"Abstract:
What if you're not the CTO and you want to improve your quality, performance and stability. 
This is my story of working within low buy-in, legacy, siloed organizations to break down barriers, blur borders and eliminate constraints. I’ll also tie in material from ‘Driving Technical Change’ and ‘Building a DevOps Culture’

Detail:
This is a rework of my talk from Paris, focused more on actionable techniques and tactics for making progress

We’ll cover:
- tribes and guilds vs teams
- winning trust and building confidence
- simple risk and roi
- low impact tools

Audience:
Anyone struggling with introducing or or accelerating change in their organization

Pitch:
Clear guidance on navigating a corporate nightmare to make progress with DevOps"
