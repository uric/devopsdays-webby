title: The devops laboratory
---
"This talk will be going over 3 years of experiments in a medium/large sized online organization with a high pride of its devops culture and a massive push for autonomy in the business areas and teams that have provided lots of interesting results. 

Some of the experiments that will be covered include:

Centralized vs Secondments vs Embedded Operations
The raise and decay of the first devops/tooling team
Dedicated ops per team/stream, how many ops is too many ops
Decentralize > Centralize > Decentralize > Centralize and so on
The raise of the delivery engineering teams, sometimes called devops teams and sometimes BAU

The focus of the talk would be focused on both cultural and technical aspects, but a bigger lean towards the first area.

How these will be solved in the future"
