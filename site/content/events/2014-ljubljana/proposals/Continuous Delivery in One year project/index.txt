title: "Continuous Delivery in One year project"
---
**Abstract:**

At OLX we started a project a year ago to make Continuous Delivery a reality in our daily deployment operations. This is a story of our journey, lessons learned, technology applied (Jenkins / github / bash), and a web app for orchestrating the whole thing that we decided to open-source. How we change people's minds and applied Devops principles without people even knowing about the term, how we went up from 10 deployments a week, to over 50, more than 10-per-day.

All the tools we created around deployment process, like IRC bots and JIRA tickets auto-creation and transition.
