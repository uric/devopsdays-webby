title: "Next Generation File Systems"
---
**Abstract:**

With Moore's law still holding out for storage, such massive amounts of data
are stored on ever cheaper hardware, that new file systems must perform many
tasks in addition to mere bookkeeping. The storage technologies also forked
into low latency solid state media and high capacity magnetic media, which has
important implications on how file systems operate to make the best use of
what is available.

The talk will present what developers working with files should learn to
expect from these new file systems, with focus on ZFS and Btrfs, explaining
features that are considered crucial for modern file systems, such as
checksumming data and doing read-repair, features that can make a big impact
on performance and also the shift of volume management into file systems
themselves in order to better optimize storage access times and bandwidth.
Ultimately I will try to explain how most important features are implemented
in practice and how this changes things for people used to working with older
file systems, especially from performance and reliability standpoints, both in
simple and complex computing environments.
