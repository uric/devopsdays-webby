# Submit an ignite talk!

You can still submit an ignite talk, a 5 minute presentation, so go ahead, show us
that cool thing you just found out about!
  
An Ignite talk will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room<

	<li>The impact devops has on traditional security/auditing/change control</li>
	<li>How does devops co-exist with ITIL, Cobit</li>
  <li>How about release management ?
	<li>What about configuration management and delivery in Mixed Unix AND Windows environments</li>
  <li>Building dashboards because #monitoringsucks
	<li>The impact of devops on HR policies, and the hiring process</li>
	<li>Help prove that devops can scale beyond the 5-8 person web startups, we love traditional IT enterprise cases</li>
	<li>With all the automation, data is still a hard thing to handle, how does it affect, DBA's, backup strategies, ...</li>
	<li>How to involve the business in devops</li>
