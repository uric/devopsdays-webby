title: Lean ITSM

**Abstract:**
IT is the Business and the Business is IT
Name one thing that you can do, no matter the role, that adds value to your business:

- More customers
- Make employees more effective, productive, efficient
- Enable communication or collaboration
- Make you more competitive or compliant

And does not in any shape before the activity, during the activity or after the activity?

IT Dev is constrained by not enough resources (people, processes, technology) and OPS is simply over-worked and not allowed to be a part of the solution.  

Traditionally this void was filled by ITIL ITSM but you can Lean ITSM by blending processes and then matching the roles (People + tools) to introduce that process.  Examples Problem management as a subset of Incident, redefining Change Management by blending change-release-configuration.

Doing this with SMART and Visual KPIs can quickly show the business leaders, staff, vendors even customers that this is a business or organisation that has a clue as to how to keep up with market, regulatory, customer requirements and trends.
