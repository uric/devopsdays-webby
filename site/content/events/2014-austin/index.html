  <h4>When Is This DevOps Unicorn Going to Sprout Wings and Fly <small>(Michael Cote)</small></h4>
  <p><a href="http://coteindustries.com/post/84832061261/devops-unicorn-devopsdays-austin-2014">View slides</a></p>
  <p>We have been following DevOps for many years and it always seems to portend much awesomeness in the future. Who wouldn't want to deliver more software more often? Sadly, based on how little we, as analysts, see DevOps in practice, it still seems like something of a unicorn. Interestingly, this has been changing rapidly. This presentation will present 451's freshest analysis of where the DevOps market is in maturity, including a DevOps practitioner survey (based on 200 DevOps and DevOps-minded folks), early market-sizing, a landscape overview and quantitative market studies - along with plenty of silly, but nonetheless helpful qualitative hand-waving. Our gut instinct is that DevOps is following a pattern very similar to Agile Development and open source, which are two cycles we can use to think about DevOps. There are some early best practices andÂ cases to go over, but very few - part of what we hope to suss out with this talk are more stories from the field. Our early studies show that there's much room for improvement, but a nice zeal for doing the actual work. The unicorn seems close to sprouting wings.</p>

  <h4>YOU ARE NOT DEVOPS - learn you the business for great good <small>(Andrew Clay Shafer)</small></h4>
  <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/littleidea/devopsdays-austin-no-true-devops">View slides</a></p>
  <p>Humans are deeply tribal, ignore this at your peril. We inevitably create narratives about ourselves and each other that define our identities. The narratives can also impose our limitations. Don't be devops, don't even do devops, be awesome.</p>

  <h4>Console Access For All 15,000 Clients? Are You Crazy? <small>(RC Johnson)</small></h4>
  <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rcjohnson42/02-rc-johnson-dev-ops-days-2014-console-access-for-all">View slides</a></p>
  <p>WP Engine is building it's newest feature as we speak: the ability for all 15,000 customers to have shell like access to their system. We already allow customers to run almost any code they'd like within WordPress, but command line access is another massive risk altogether. I'll discuss the system design as well as how we're keeping this locked down and secure while still being flexible and fast.</p>

  <h4>Configuration Management... How Much More Can You Improve? <small>(Joe Gardner)</small></h4>
  <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joehack3r/devopsdays-austin-configuration-management-evolution">View slides</a></p>
  <p>Configuring servers has evolved from the bearded Unix admin to wikis to configuration management tools which is where many people are today. This has resulted in machines that can be repeatedly reproduced from code and are often managed as code. This lightning talk will quickly show the evolution of configuring servers and identify the ephemeral, immutable machines as an ideal we should be striving to achieve.</p>

  <h4>The DevOps Centipede <small>(Ernest Mueller)</small></h4>
  <p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mxyzplk/the-devops-centipede">View slides</a></p>
  <p>Conway's Law is used to describe the Frankenapps that result when different parts of an organization create different parts of a product. The striation of dev, QA, and ops teams also provokes Conway's Law, creating a "Human Centipede" where teams pass their product downstream to other teams, and it's just as harmful. Can you beat Conway's Law, and if so, how?</p>

  <h4>The Director of Devops <small>(Boyd Hemphill)</small></h4>
  <p>I am a builder of culture, I run a service organization. The people I hire focus on making it better across the entire business. We identify silos and build paths between them. Then we tear them down. I don't direct a silo of specialists, I direct the implementation of a philosophy and culture. Do you?</p>
