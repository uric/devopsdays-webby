<h4><a href="https://ti.to/devopsdaysnyc/devopsdays-nyc-2015/" target="_blank">Registration is open</a>!</h4>

<!--
Free t-shirts are a tradition at most tech conferences. But then again, devopsdays is <em>not</em> like most conferences! So this year, instead printing yet another conference t-shirt, devopsdays NYC is donating $12 of your registration fee to the non-profit <a href="http://lotusoutreach.org/" target="_blank">Lotus Outreach</a>. With this money, we will build a deep-bore water well that will provide life-saving clean, safe drinking water to approximately 200 rural villagers in Cambodia for years to come. To learn more about Lotus Outreach and this program, please see this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6GP6WNYeeA&amp;list=UUfQFMpprcxr4HvbjIyDws8w" target="_blank">video</a>.
