<hr>

The DevopsDays New York CFP is <b>closed</b>. This year we accepted submissions for 6 30-minute talks and 10 ignite talks - all submitters will be notified on or by <b>April 7th, 2015</b>. Please note that while submissions were anonymized before review to remove submittersâ€™ names and email addresses before review, the content of the proposals were not altered so any potentially identifiable information in the proposal content such as company name (if you mentioned it) will be visible to reviewers. The themes for this devopsdays are inclusivity, complexity, and empathy- for more information, please see <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/devops-keeps-it-cool-with-ice.html#disqus_thread">DevOps keeps it cool with ICE</a>.

<hr/>

There are two ways to propose a session:
<ol>
	<li><b><i>A proposal for a talk/panel during the conference part:</i></b> These are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><b><i>An <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format/">ignite talk</a></i></b> that will be presented during the Ignite sessions. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
</ol>

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:
<ul>
<li><i>original content</i>: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem</li>
<li><i>new presenters</i>: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice</li>
<li><i>no vendor pitches</i>: we value vendors and sponsors, but this is not the right forum</li>
<li><i>on theme</i>: our themes this year are inclusivity, complexity, and empathy; we want to hear your takes on these themes</i>
</ul>

<b><i>How to submit a proposal</i></b>: Send an email to [<a href="mailto:proposals-nyc-2015@devopsdays.org">proposals-nyc-2015@devopsdays.org</a>] with the following information:
<ol>
	<li>Working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, or ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>

<b>Rules:</b>
<ul>
<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
<li>Propose your own talk... don't have your marketing department do it for you</li>
<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the devops conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
