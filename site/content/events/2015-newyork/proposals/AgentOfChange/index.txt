title: "Agent of Change? Here's Your Helmet."
---

**Abstract:**
A company that wants help bootstrapping a DevOps culture shift may seem like an attractive move for someone who is looking to make a move?  What's not to like?  There seems to be a lot of these jobs now.  It looks like a chance to make your name, and heavily influence a culture that wants to be influenced.

But this path is fraught with peril.  Choosing the wrong company - especially as an Agent of Change - could harm your health and your career.  In this talk, I will describe

- What problems do they want you to solve?
- The ways that companies delude themselves.
- The people that you'll meet.
- The roadblocks that you'll encounter.
- The questions that you should ask before deciding to take the job.
