title: "Trials and tribulations of database container orchestration"
---

**Abstract:**
This talk will be about container orchestration, how it can make our lives easier and the pain points of managing a database in containers. Orchestration has come along way from home brewed scripts managing LXCs to mesosphere and the official docker tools; but these tools have been built mostly for stateless applications and stateful databases present a new set of challenges. Discovery, mapping host  volumes, and even how to restart containers.  

**Speaker:**
