title: "Devops for the Masses"
---

**Abstract:**
Two core tenets of DevOps are culture and sharing. While devOps is proliferating through the tech industry there are still daily instances of exclusion, cruelty, and indifference. As an engineer, a husband, and a father I am in a constant struggle of trying to being inclusive without being intrusive.

An understanding of the robustness that diversity provides only complicates this matter further. Sometimes we have to work with people we don't prefer and sometimes we have to perform tasks we'd rather avoid. This should not prevent us from respecting each other, working together, and enjoying it too.

Please join me as we explore:
-The perceived threat of diversity
-The actual strength diversity provides
-Why diversity is good for business
-Ways to increase diversity in your organization
