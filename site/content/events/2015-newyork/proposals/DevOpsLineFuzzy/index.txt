title: "The Dev/Ops Line is Fuzzy, or How to Work with your Ops Partners"
---

**Abstract:**
I manage an infrastructure team, and we're having to learn which ops
things we do, and which ops things we hand off. And it turns out not
to be a clear line, but a process of working together with our
designated ops. I figure 5 minutes introducing my team and the kind of
problems we have, 10 minutes talking about how we're working with ops:
we have primary/secondary/advisory ops members and they are on our
team mailing list. They are invited to our weekly meetings, but have
access to the agenda so they can decide for themselves if they want to
attend. I have a 1:1 with our primary ops person every 2 weeks so I
can find out how much bandwidth she's got and she can hear what things
I'm worried about and might need help with soon. We work together on
hardware buying, where we find the timing that make the most sense to
both parties, talk about what hardware meets our needs, and make sure
they have everything they need to order it. Sometimes we write chef
code. Sometimes we build RPMs. Sometimes we pair with Ops people. It
depends on urgency, bandwidth, available skills, and interest.
I can slide in the horror story of the week spent double teaming NSLCD
and losing. :)

Then 10 minutes talking about what is generalizable about these things
- communicate, communicate, cooperate! I love your theme of empathy
and I think this fits well with it - it's about being on the same
team, understanding that we have conflicting constraints, and helping
each other achieve goals.
Final five minutes: quick things you can do to make your ops
relationship better (probably 3 different suggestions for how to open
dialogue), wild ideas about how to make the relationship even better
in the future.
