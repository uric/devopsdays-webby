title: "Developing empathy though process mapping"
---

**Abstract:**
What do you do when your API is "open a ticket"?

At a past employer, [PRESENTER] found himself responsible for a process that,
when finally mapped, involved 12 teams, 30 steps, and 27 hand-offs
between teams.  Most teams only saw their own "box". The process took
6+ weeks to complete and there were usually 3-4 instances of the
process active at any given time (about 24 executions of the process
each year).

The "API" for most of the steps was to open a ticket with that team,
making a request and waiting for the request to complete.  A project
manager literally spent hours each day watching which tickets were
getting attention and pushing the process along.

The team:
1.  Mapped the entire process.  It took 3+ months to just find out
there were 30 steps and 27 handoffs.
2.  Held "empathy" meetings with each team to help them see how they
fit into the process, brainstorm optimizations, and enroll the teams
in process improvements.
3.  Wrote a robot that watched the tickets automatically. Eventually
it could see that one ticket was complete and open the next tickets
(that had been blocked) automatically.  It included a status dashboard
and generated stats about lead time and SLA compliance.

Sadly [PRESENTER] left the company without taking any screen caps and the
system hasn't been open sourced, so you'll have to believe me and my
hand-drawn slides :-)  However, I'll gladly discuss details after the
Ignite talks are over if anyone would like to write a clone.
