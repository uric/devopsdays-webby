title: "From Dev-Box to Production - The Un-Orthodox Ways - A Short Story"
---

**Abstract:**

Prologue
What's this all about

Chapter -1 (What it means to a Developer)
As a Developer, I love doing away with all things from the path of writing code, to
putting it ahead for QA. In this chapter I discuss about things and preferences as a
developer to setup a machine from scratch, get code working, working on a feature set,
pushing it to staging, with stress on the "pushing it to staging" part, and how services like
instapusher or snap-ci matter to fill-in the missing link.

Chapter -2 (That Devops Guy)
This Chapter is about that unorthodox Devops guy. It speaks about how he doesn't see chef as just a configuration management
tool, but takes it a level ahead and uses it for complete deployment process.
It speaks about how right after RPM creation chef is used to setup runtime behaviour of a node and deploying
as per the role assigned to that node. And everyone's favourite - deploying hot fixes directly to production.

Epilogue
Go Forth do stupid stuff
