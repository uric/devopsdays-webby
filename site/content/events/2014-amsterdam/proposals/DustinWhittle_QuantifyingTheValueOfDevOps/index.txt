title: "Quantifying the value of DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps, when done right, usually goes unnoticed. It’s only when something breaks that all eyes turn to IT. If your boss only sees you when the app is down, however, that’s not really doing your career any favors. In this session we’ll talk about how to prove your value to the organization by looking at the positive side – that is, how much money you’ve saved your company. We’ll take a look at how you can use tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Sensu and Logstash/Kibana to quantify your value to your company. After this session, you’ll be able to walk into a meeting with your boss ready to talk about your teams value to the company.
