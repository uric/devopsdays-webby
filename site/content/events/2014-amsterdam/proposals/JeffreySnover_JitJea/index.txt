title: "Just In Time, Just Enough Administration"

**Abstract:**

JitJea - A PowerShell toolkit to secure a post-Snowden world:
When asked what to do about corporate hacking, Ex NSA Director Michael Hayden replied, "Man up and defend yourselves".   Within a few years, Edward Snowden rocked the world by disclosing information he had gathered using his NSA administrative privileges.  JitJea stands for Just In Time, Just Enough Admin.  It is a PowerShell toolkit that you can use to "man up and defend yourselves" by allowing admins to perform functions without giving them admin privileges.
