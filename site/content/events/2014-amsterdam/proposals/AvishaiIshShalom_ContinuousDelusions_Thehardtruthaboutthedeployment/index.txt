title: "Continuous Delusions - The hard truth about the deployment"
---

**Abstract:**

Lately it seems that whatever conference you attend everyone is talking about Continuous Delivery: tools, success stories, services, books.... you name it. To some people, it seems that DevOps is about Continuous Delivery. But is this really the case? How come CD is such a prominent term? and what is it really about?

This talk will give a radically different viewpoint of CD; By contrasting deployments with other production processes we can gain an insight on often overlooked aspects of deployments and Production Ops: culture, architecture, monitoring and control.

**Speaker:**

Avishai Ish-Shalom is an Ops/IT consultant working for Fewbytes - an Israel based consultancy firm.
