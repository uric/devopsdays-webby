title: "Building a culture of DevOps from the ground up"
---

**Abstract:**

As a young company, it's fairly easy to stay flexible and adapt quickly. However, as your company grows you become more rigid and it becomes more difficult to change processes and the overall team culture. In our session we'd like to discuss how to build a culture around the alignment of developers, operations, and the executive team. We'll cover the tools, strategy, and philosophy that has proven to enable cultural change in our respective companies. Attendees of this session will leave knowing the specific tools which foster collaboration and a blueprint to take with them to cultivate organizational change.
