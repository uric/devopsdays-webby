title: "Open Source end 2 end monitoring solution"
---

**Abstract:**

We've built an end-2-end monitoring system using Jenkins which runs system tests every 5 mins,
This allows us to know if our service is working from a visitor perspective.

We used only open-source solutions like:
1) Jenkins
2) Selenium
3) Dashing - Dashboard for NOC
4) Graphite - Runtime and availability trends

You can read more about it here:

We replace our BAC (HP system) with the one we build, it saves us money, but more importantly, it gave us a better view and tools to monitor our service.
