title: "Building a Loosely Coupled Toolchain with Rundeck and Puppet"
---

**Abstract:**
Inspired by the talk "Using Rundeck and Chef to build DevOps Toolchains"
given by Anthony Shortland during ChefConf 2012
(http://dev2ops.org/2012/05/using-rundeck-and-chef-to-build-devops-toolchains-at-chefcon/)
we set out to include Rundeck as part of a loosely coupled toolchain
when building the new datacenter at Bol.com. This talk will explore how
we took the ideas from Shortland's talk and implemented them in the
context of Jenkins, Gerrit, Puppet and MCollective.

I will share how we met the challenges of changing configuration with
automatic deployments, needing an easy to use interface for
non-technical users while retaining control and power for the techies.

Due to the scope it will necessarily be a high-level overview but with
just enough detail to demonstrate how all the pieces fit and work together.


**Speaker:**

Steven Meunier is a System Engineer at Bol.com where he has
spent the last two years building the deployment toolchain while seeing
how far he can push Puppet and gained an appreciation for Ruby in the
process.
