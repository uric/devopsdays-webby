title: "Reality Driven DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**
What is one of the most important differences between Medieval Europe and the Age of Enlightenment? It’s the importance we put in facts. To be more precisely it’s the combination of clearly stated principles, experimentation and the will to learn and adjust principles accordingly. The ideas driving the Enlightenment are still of great value to DevOps.

Hypotheses are everywhere. In ideas from the business to increase growth, in assumptions by technical teams on how to fix certain problems, and how new functionality will work once in production.

Using examples from live web sites, Adriaan and Ruben will share their experiences. They will show real examples where using metrics shortened lead times, prevented waste and helped teams improve their service to the customers.

Participants will have a better view on uncertainty in building and running IT systems and how to use that to their advantage.
