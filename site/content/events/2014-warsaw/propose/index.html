<hr/>

There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minutes slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Please check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
</ol>

### Even if you don't propose, please consider [commenting on proposals submitted by others](../proposals/)

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to tell, we want to hear everbody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors, sponsors and partners, we just don't think this is the right forum. There is a demo openspace slot where you have 5 minutes to show products.

<strong>Some suggestions to get you thinking:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>What is the role of QA/Tester in DevOps, how do we integrate QA in the continuous delivery process?</li>
  <li>The impact DevOps has on traditional security/auditing/change control</li>
  <li>How does DevOps co-exist with ITIL and Cobit?</li>
  <li>How about Release Management?
  <li>What about configuration management and delivery in Mixed Unix AND Windows environments?</li>
  <li>Building dashboards because #monitoringsucks
  <li>The impact of DevOps on HR policies and hiring process</li>
  <li>Help prove that DevOps can scale beyond the 5-8 person web startups, we love traditional IT enterprise cases</li>
  <li>With all the automation, data is still a hard thing to handle, how does it affect, DBA's, backup strategies, etc?</li>
  <li>How to involve the business in DevOps?</li>
  <li>How to get YOUR boss involved, how do you make the business case?</li>
  <li>And of course any other topic in the realm of DevOps</li>
  <li>Beyond Configuration Management, about challenges like orchestration, or doing things at large scale</li>
</ul>

<strong>How to make a proposal:</strong> Send an email to [<a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %>"><%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %></a>] with the following information:
<ol>
  <li>Proposal working title (can be changed later)</li>
  <li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, moderated general discussion, debate, etc.,ignite)</li>
  <li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>
<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
  <li> English is the main language of our event... and of the talks as well</li>
  <li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
  <li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
  <li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
  <li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
