**Abstract:**

Back in 2011 at Prezi we started off with a single SQL query that worked on a few megabytes of data and produced somewhat accurate numbers satisfying basic business needs. This used to be our BI platform. Today we run a data infrastructure with around 70 high-performance servers that crunch hundreds of gigabytes of data and feed hundreds of reports day by day.
Along this journey we used standard Unix and statistical software, later on-premise Hadoop clusters, NoSQL databases and third-party BI tools. Learning from our mistakes we rebuilt our data infrastructure and ETL systems many times.
We’ll share the successes and misses we encountered throughout this journey with a special focus on our current experiences with managed solution
