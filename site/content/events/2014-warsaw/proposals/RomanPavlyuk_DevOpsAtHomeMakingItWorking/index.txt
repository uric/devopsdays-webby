**Abstract:**

A lightweight presentation about how I applied my DevOps practices to make them working at home: Zabbix to monitor
electric equipment and appliances and Chef to perform smart home automation. Also, it is not just monitoring but some
interesting analytics behind it â€” almost like in real enterprise company but in very tiny scale :)

**Speaker:**

I have 12+year of experience in IT where DevOps and Operations is almost 8+ years. Currently working at SoftServe Inc in
Lviv, Ukraine. I regularly take part as a speaker in DevOpsDays events, especially in Austin, TX and Tel-Aviv.
