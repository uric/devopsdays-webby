**Abstract:**

What does Soviet military hardware from the cold war era have in common with devops? Well, they both work in harsh conditions and both benefit from the KISS principle. Catch a few glimpses into how the Soviets' war machine worked and look for lessons for devops, which may or may not include heavy artillery fire.
