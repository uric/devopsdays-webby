**Abstract:**

This talk will cover the changes of the last 6-7 years in development and IT that have driven the requirement for changing the behavior of IT organizations. No longer is it acceptable to provide long lead times in IT operations (and development). In addition, I will talk about what the very essence of DevOps is (to me), and movements within DevOps that can help change the behavior of IT organizations.
