title: "How to create dynamic automated report of your unstable jenkins jobs"
---

**Abstract:**

Who doesn't hate monitoring and fixing unstable jenkins jobs?
How many times your manager asked you for a report on latest failing jobs and their reason?
This is a really painful topic for us at our devops team in RHEV, so we decided to automate that report.
Today a job can fail due to some major reasons:
 1. bug is open on the product and still open (on bugzilla)
 2. the testing framework has a bug (on jira)
 3. issue that is monitoring on trac system
 4. work in progress - job is not final

In this talk we'll show you how using a very simple text in the job desc ("api"), you can create automated report
that will show your manager the reasons for the recent failures on ci and thier status (e.g - for a bug it will show it's status and current assignee).
We might even show you how to skip those "known" issues so you can focus on the unknown failures you might be missing.
