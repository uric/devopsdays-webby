title: "How to fail at DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

As a DevOps consultant I have made numerous serious mistakes by myself and saw the consequences of mistakes made by others.
In this talk I'd like to present the common and not so common DevOps antipatterns.
I would also talk about what looked like bad ideas, but turned to be good and about methodologies that will enable the practitioners to fail less.

**Speakers:**

Pavel is a DevOps consultant and entrepreneur.

Pavel has 15 years of experience in IT and Operations.
He is very enthusiastic about the recent explosion of interest for operations in software companies.
Pavel has  3 kids.
