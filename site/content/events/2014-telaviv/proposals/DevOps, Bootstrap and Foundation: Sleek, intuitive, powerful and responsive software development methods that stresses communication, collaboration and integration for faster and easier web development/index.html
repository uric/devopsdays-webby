title: "DevOps, Bootstrap and Foundation: Sleek, intuitive, powerful and responsive software development methods that stresses communication, collaboration and integration for faster and easier web development"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps related solutions usually focus around measurement and incentives; unified processes and unified tooling to change culture. In this presentation, Chaim Cohen will demonstrate how Bootstrap and Foundation are both sleek, intuitive, and powerful responsive front-end frameworks for faster and easier web development that allow for fast and responsive, yet stable, operations that can be kept in sync with the pace of innovation coming out of development processes. He will focus on how both frameworks focus on bridging development and unified operations tooling as their infrastructure is their code and they are constantly in the process of continuous development and deployment. He will show how both sport version-controlled software libraries, which ensures that all system artifacts are well defined, consistently shared, and up to date across the release lifecycle. After a site is developed, both Development and QA organizations can draw from the exact same platform versions, and production groups can deploy the exact same versions that have been certified by QA. The presentation will show how Bootstrap and Foundation are both deeply modeled systems, making it simple to reproduce a system on demand or to introduce change without conflicts. With the linkage to common script and style libraries and the integration with state of the art open source content management systems, both frameworks support automation of tasks that empower high-velocity, conflict-free and massive-scale maintenance and administration. To close the presentation, Chaim will compare the most current versions of both frameworks, demonstrating each ones approaches to Grids, Multi Screen/Multi Device, UI’s, Widgets and provisioning aspects including both frameworks ability to deploy, update, and repair application infrastructure using relatively automated procedures.
