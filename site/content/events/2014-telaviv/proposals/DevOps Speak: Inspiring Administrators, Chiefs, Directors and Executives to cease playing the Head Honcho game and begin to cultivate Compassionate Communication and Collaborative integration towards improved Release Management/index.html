title: "DevOps Speak: Inspiring Administrators, Chiefs, Directors and Executives to cease playing the Head Honcho game and begin to cultivate Compassionate Communication and Collaborative integration towards improved Release Management"
---

**Abstract:**

This presentation focuses on direct actions that can be implemented to get DevOps to work in and for one’s company, taking into consideration technical and social-cultural challenges; fundamental misalignment of incentives and conflicts in incentives in pushing through organizational change. Chaim will explain in detail approaches on how to get the DevOps ball rolling, how to get on the right soapbox to overcome corporate-cultural resistance to change and how to use DevOps Speak to advance DevOps awareness, orientation and development environments. He will demonstrate how DevOps can help create a competitive advantage while improving Release Management by becoming the intersection of development, technology operations and quality assurance. The presentation will show different ways to build trust and create safety; how to get colleagues to feel that they are champions at what they do; how to utilize metrics and key performance indicators; how to encourage, recognize and celebrate success and how to best hack and maneuver events to create cultural permission to make important change.
