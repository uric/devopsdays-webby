---

**Abstract:**

Centralize infrastructure (DB, rabbit, reddis, etc…) for you developers & deployments killing you – we were there J.
Centralize infrastructure like db, rabbit, redis for development and deployments over the globe is very expensive, even you have puppet || chef
1.       Load
2.       Problem to create clusters on same machine
2.       Latency
3.       Work from home
4.       Very expensive machines
5.       Maintenance
6.       Etc…
 
Docker vs Vagrant is our solution
Requirements
•       Run on my machine – NO dependencies
•       I can control what (deploy partially stack)
•       Versioned – everything as code
•       Component version support
•       Build process Jenkins – why not
•       Monitoring
•       Integrate with my IDE  !!!
•       Orchestration
•       Control
•       Logs to developers
 
Usage of Docker inside continuous integration process – Docker & Jenkins
Integration inside development group over 3 regions more than 150 developers took 3 weeks
We want to share our experience how to do it right J
