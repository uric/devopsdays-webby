---

**Abstract:**

If you’re working in a DevOps shop, focus on business metrics is key. However, you want to derive those metrics and the data to support meeting those key performance indicators coming from tools that support effective collaboration with a minimum of misery.
 
Enter the Elasticsearch ELK stack:
* Elasticsearch for deep search and data analytics
* Logstash for centralized logging, log enrichment and parsing
* Kibana for powerful and beautiful data visualizations
 
By their powers combined, these three open source tools pair to provide you with all the tools you need to understand exactly what is happening in your business, from your systems generated data to each and every click from your users.
 
In this workshop, you will learn: 
* The ELK Stack: overview, set-up and deployment
* How to use our brand new visualization engine, Kibana 4, to best extract insights from your data
* How using the ELK stack provides the perfect tool set for collaboration across teams, not just Dev and Ops, but *all* of your colleagues

We’ll step through each of these points through analyzing publicly accessible data sets. We’ll go step by step - ingest data into Logstash, run analytics queries across it using Elasticsearch and then visualizing it all in Kibana’s simple and beautiful dashboards. You’ll leave know how to put together yet another cool demo for everyone to play with.
