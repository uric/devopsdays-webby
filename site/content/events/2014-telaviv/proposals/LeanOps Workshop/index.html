title: "LeanOps Workshop"
---

**Abstract:**

 Good production systems require that operators address three issues that are pervasive and fundamental to operations management: eliminate waste, remove variability, and improve throughput. This workshop will build upon examples from the audience, and teach how you can methodologically get your operations lean-er by learning and using some of the TPS, 6Ïƒ and ToC techniques in an IT operations context.

**Speaker:**

Evgeny is a consultant at <a href="http://www.devops.co.il/">Devops Israel</a>. For the last 11 years he has been involved in helping and teaching developers in companies big and small get a better handle on the operations side of their programming.
