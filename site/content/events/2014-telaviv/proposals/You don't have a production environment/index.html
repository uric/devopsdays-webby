title: "You don't have a production environment"
---

**Abstract:**

"Production" environment, a dominant term in our industry, is a remnant of hardware factories and doesn't actually fit in our software, service oriented industry. In fact, using this term makes people adopt bad habits and inadequate methodologies. I would like to suggest an alternate term which better aligns with the way we work in our businesses.
