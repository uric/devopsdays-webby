title: "DevOps is not a Dev Oops!"
---

**Abstract:**

Technologies evolved dramatically in the last few years to support the needs of production environment. 
Tools like Puppet changed the way we can apply configuration in a massive scale and provisioning new prototypes easily. 
Application Containers (i.e. Dockers) changed our way to package/patch and deliver application in a simplest and fastest manner. 
NoSql databases and specifically mongoDB changed the way we are dealing with none structural data and Hadoop burned the barriers to big data.
DevOps concept brought developers and operations teams together to build the strongest infrastructure and to gain customers satisfaction and loyalty.
Despite these dramatic changes of our technological environment  we still use the same 10years-old development  methodologies: 
Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban - which should be already obsolete or at least adjusted to address the need of being more flexible in decision making, tasks and integration forces and mutual adjustment to our rapidly developing industry.
In this presentation we will cover how we use cloud circles methodology to implement VMware vRealize Air platform for SaaS management, while walkthrough a real e2e phase of our SDLC.
