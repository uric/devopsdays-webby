title: "Building a Massively Scalable Cloud Service from the Grounds Up"
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk, we’ll go into excruciating technical detail about building a greenfield, massively scalable cloud service. As many of us are assembling open source and SaaS components to power our next generation applications, it seems as easy as choosing the leaders in each space and just gluing them together using APIs. This sentiment couldn’t possibly be more wrong. Along the path to constructing a scalable cloud service, there are many options and critical decisions to take.

This talk covers our missteps and our revised successful choices of building Bintray. We will share our challenges and how it affected our approach towards issues like: segmenting the system; supporting horizontal scaling; physical vs virtual hosts; handling cross data center deployments; managing redundancy; and supporting a cloud-based development environment. Many of these approaches you can replicate in your own construction of your next cloud solution.
