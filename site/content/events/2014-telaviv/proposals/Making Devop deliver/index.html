**Abstract:**

"You use all the hot tools but still the process sucks, things break and you ask yourself what Am I doing wrong?

In this talk ill cover the quick bullets points you should check:

Symmetric workflow/philosophy across the board (even configuration should be tested)
Source as the only source of knowledge
Keep things simple
Question everything, accept things based on facts and experimentation
Bring back the DEV in devops"

**Speakers:**

A Clojurist Rubiest and aspiring Erlangist with passion for fringe useful technology ranging from Devops to large scale data crunching and plain out of the mil unix treasure troves (heck iv been doing Angular JS lately so there isn't any limit really).
I've been filling the lead architect title, which in my book means coding and driving change using moderate elbow work
