title: "DevOps Culture"
---

**Abstract:**

There are a lot of talks about so-called DevOps tools: Puppet here, Chef there, Ansible, and now Docker. Questions like “what constitutes DevOps culture?”, “why close cooperation between dev and ops is so important?” and “under which circumstances this close cooperation would be counter-productive?” are less frequently addressed even though exactly these issues constitute the DevOps spirit rather than letter. Based on the talk I’m going to give at Cisco internal DevOps unconference.

**Speakers:**
