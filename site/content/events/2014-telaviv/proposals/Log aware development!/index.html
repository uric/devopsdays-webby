title: "Log aware development!"
---

**Abstract:**

Logs are usually the domain of Ops. (This isn't very "DevOps-ish", is it?) If you relate to that saying, I'd like to tell you why you're wrong.
So what do we do? What is the missing piece to make logging better? Why isn't ELK enough and how can you make sure you actually managed to hijack the correct credit card number? All of that and more...

**Speakers:**

Nir Cohen was the Ops Team Leader at fring and now works for Gigaspaces. He's a relatively short, brown eyed human being who loves animals and holds true to Ethics as a life path. He also likes to walk long distances, breathe and eat lettuce salad. You can find Nir at work, on the street or at home.
