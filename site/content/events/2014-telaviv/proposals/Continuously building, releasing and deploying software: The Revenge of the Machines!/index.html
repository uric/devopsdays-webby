title: "Continuously building, releasing and deploying software: The Revenge of the Machines!"
---

**Abstract:**

We used to release one product, once a year, built by one team. Today we have teams of hundreds of developers creating a multitude of software packages that are released multiple times a day.
How did that happen?! In this talk, we’ll give you the answer: As the good old advice of Computer Science goes, “If it hurts, do it more often!”. 
Suddenly, we realized that what we do during the “Release Month Code Freeze” is actually a lot of repeatable, automatable steps. So, we called in the machines.
Now we have Continuous Integration servers controlling an exponential amount of robot developers (agents) that are building and testing our code, all day long. Continuous Deployment tools, dictating their order to robot sysadmin, deploying our software on a rapidly increasing amount of varied platforms, as frequent as we please.
The Machines got their revenge, and “we, for one, welcome our new robotic overlords”!

**Speakers:**

Shiran has a diverse background in software development, and for the last couple of years has been working as a software engineer at JFrog, the home of Artifactory and Bintray. As a member of the Bintray team, she has developed both client and server side code using Groovy, Java, HTML, JavaScript and more.
