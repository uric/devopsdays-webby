title: "Developers are from Mars + Operations people are from Venus"
---

**Abstract:**

Developers and Operations people are different creatures – sometimes they seem that they come from a totally different planet. They think differently – have different outlooks on life, on how tasks should be managed, and how an infrastructure should be managed. Can the twain meet? This session will discuss the intricate differences between the two species, and how one should bridge the gaps between them – so that your company can make true use of a Devops culture – and take your company to a whole different level.
