title: "Why Application Delivery belongs in the Cloud"
---

**Abstract:**

Traditionally application delivery solutions were run off physical appliances inside the data centers and in many cases they were integrated into a load balancer. With more applications moving to the cloud, load balancers and application delivery solutions are on the move as well.
So where are load balancers moving to? Who is responsible for application delivery when its hosted in the cloud? How does this affect the technology and the way it is used?
In this talk we will discuss the growing role CDNs and PaaS vendors take in application delivery and why the natural place for application delivery solutions is being part of a CDN. Both CDNs and PaaS are in a good position to close the gap that is created when applications move to the cloud. However, while PaaS providers are copying on premise application delivery technology into their own platforms CDNs are expanding on the concept and creating new use cases for application delivery.
Moving application delivery to the cloud makes a lot of sense. It can supports both cloud and physical environment, monitoring is easier, managing a large deployment is simpler and solutions are more cost effective. Part of this talk will review new and old challenges faced by DevOps and how they are better addressed by cloud based application delivery.
