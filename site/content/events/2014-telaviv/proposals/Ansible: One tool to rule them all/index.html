title: "Ansible: One tool to rule them all"
---

**Abstract:**

Almost every internet company will start, at some point, searching for a reasonable solution for infrastructure automation, configuration management and application deployment. The holy grail would be to find that one tool that can do everything in the magical realm of automation - from small one-time tasks to massive server provisioning and orchestration. We believe, at BigPanda, that we found that holy grail - and it’s called Ansible. In less than 6 months, and with only one DevOps guy, we reached a point where there isn’t a single automation task that’s not implemented with Ansible - from the smallest of patches (e.g. Heartbleed), through all our application deployments to full fledged data center provisioning. Everything is ansiblized - no exceptions made. In this presentation I will be talking about our considerations for choosing Ansible, what exactly we’re doing with it and what kind of tools we built on top of it to make is even more fun to use.
