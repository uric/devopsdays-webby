**Abstract:**

During last May we were required to migrate our main NY datacenter to a new physical facility. 
As you can imagine a data center migration requires careful planning to mitigate risks and avoid network outages. 
But we had only 1 month notice.
The challenge was big, there were twists in the plot, but I assure you there is a happy end to this story.
During the lecture you will also get a glimpse to the Outbrain culture of DevOps, the collaboration between the groups and how it works in real life under stressful time. 

**Speakers:**

Orit Yaron joined Outbrain as Head of Operations a year ago. 
Prior to that (Years 2003 - 2013) Orit has managed the Production Operations of Cyota (which was acquired by RSA), and have done various roles as a senior manager in the SaaS operation department of RSA.
