title: "From imperative to declarative with Kubernetes and Docker"
---

**Abstract:**

This talk addresses how we can move from a manual approach, imperatively telling machines what to do, to a declaratively telling clusters what we expect of them. It's a shift in thinking, and a shift in tooling. It will show attendees how they can move from a single Docker container to many containers running across a cluster of machines with Kubernetes, an open source scheduler.
