title: "How DevOps can accelerate continuous delivery"
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous delivery and Agile development demand fast time-to-market. However, in order to achieve successful continuous delivery, your R&D team needs fast builds. Yet build processes, often take long times, even hours and days. Good practices such as developer testing, QA scripts, static code analysis, unit tests, and other CPU-intensive processes result in extensive build times. This hinders deployment and prevents effective continuous integration. Multiple developers cannot work on the same code base if it takes hours to commit to the build. 
 
Learn how to solve these problems and use DevOps to accelerate continuous delivery. By utilizing idle network resources, distributing your builds across multiple cores, network distribution, and cloud resources, you can greatly accelerate build time – literally turning hours into minutes.
 
Discover the secret to accelerating software builds by up to 80%, through utilizing network and cloud-based resources – thus enabling continuous delivery.
