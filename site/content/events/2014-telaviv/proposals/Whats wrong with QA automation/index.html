title: "What's wrong with QA automation?"
---

**Abstract:**

Automated tests are arguably the most important part of a CD pipeline. Who cares if your code builds and deploys fine if it doesn't pass the filters of functional and system tests. 
And yet, time and time again QA automation proves to be the weakest link in the CD chain. Test sets are incomplete, failing tests don't get fixed, false negatives cause excessive noise and nobody is happy.
I've seen this happen in all kinds of companies, big and small. 
Now it's time  to review the challenges of integrating test automation into the CD process and present the possible ways of addressing these challenges in order to make everyone AHAP (As Happy As Possible)
