title: "Tools - Home grown or off the shelf software a short comparison"
---

**Abstract:**

When coming to a new company/startup there is usually no build system in place
even in larger companies it is still possible builds are only lightly automated.
Today more than ever there is a choice between the many systems (some free, others not) and building your own simple system.
However each path has its own pros and cons.
On the one hand, a home grown systems allows maximum flexibilty, it also allows very tight integration with the proccesses as they are in the company and usually allows for faster iteration.
On the other hand, a turnkey solution (or off the shelf software) is usually used by larger number of people, and include many features that might come in handy in the future, but at the price of doing things in a very specific way.
