title: "DevOps is Dead!"
---

**Abstract:**

Once, people used the word genius only when describing someone who really was a genius. Someone with extraordinary intellectual and perceptual capabilities. Today, every parent uses this word to describe their likely cognitively regular child. I find the same trend holds true for DevOps. And yet, that doesn't stop everyone from saying the word DevOps, a LOT (and more often than not, in a completely wrong context).

I'd like to suggest why I think this may damage a company and how the term should alternatively be treated.

**Speakers:**

Nir Cohen was the Ops Team Leader at fring and now works for Gigaspaces. He's a relatively short, brown eyed human being who loves animals and holds true to Ethics as a life path. He also likes to walk long distances, breathe and eat lettuce salad. You can find Nir at work, on the street or at home.
