title: "How I have messed up the marketing metrics of my company through my devops skills (... and how I actually made them better)"
---

**Abstract:**

We all know that good ol’marketing rely a lot on download form and tracker. Because you know, customers and prospects, they download stuff to test it. 
But I am a developer. When I test something I built it, or apt-get it, brew it, or I have been using Docker more recently (or Ansible, Chef, Puppets, Vagrant images… ) Choose your poison.
By doing so with Couchbase I have provided a way for dev and ops to test it easily. And by doing so I drove them away from the traditional marketing funnel. And this is a good thing because honestly do we really want those guys to be in our CRM? I think not. I think we have removed noise from our customer directory.  Not here to do a sociological study on the developer but guys, when we’re ready, we’ll come to you.

**Speakers:**

Laurent works at Couchbase as a Developer Advocate for Java developers and the French community. He writes code and blog posts. Before joining Couchbase he was Nuxeo's community guy.
