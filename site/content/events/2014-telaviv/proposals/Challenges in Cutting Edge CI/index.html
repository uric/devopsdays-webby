title: "Challenges in Cutting Edge CI"
---

**Abstract:**

When starting to build a fresh product it is obvious these days that it needs to be tested, integrated and delivered continuously. BUT, as time passes and the complexity of the project grows, it is becoming more and more challenging to reliably do so. This talk will share various challenging examples for complex software projects using continuous integration and demonstrate some common day-to-day dilemmas. Amongst others, topics covered will be infrastructure and tool-chain considerations and discussion around the multiple test flavors which are needed to create high quality products: server/web UI/Android/Hypervisor(!?) testing, upgrade testing, feature toggle testing, performance and stress testing, cloud-based testing, configuration management testing and disaster/failure tests. We will also discuss some common dilemmas such as when to mock/simulate and when to run full integration tests, boundaries between unit, integration and system tests, as well as the cultural impacts of being a test-driven organization.
