---

**Abstract:**

Chef or Puppet? Ansible or Cloudify? Maven or Gradle? Gerrit or Reviewboard? Jacoco or Cobertura? Artifactory or Nexus? Selenium or Jasmine? PMD or SonarQube? Logstash or Kibana?
A variety of DevOps tools and best practices today are overloading and to find out what will yield the highest ROI for your company is really a challenge. 
How not to get lost in these cutting edge technologies and what are the parameters in the equation of your best choice?
We'll present how VMware answers these questions and what are the characteristics of  the winning DevOps kit each company should aim to. We'll show how this kit can be reflected successfully in your release pipeline moving it to truly continuous delivery mode.
