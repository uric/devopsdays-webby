title: "Ready for QA. Really? - Continuously deliver valuable content"
---

**Abstract:**

The presentation focuses on the problems encountered when needing to deliver a daily build to QA.
In most cases the delivery contains maximal features with less focus on quality, which results with builds that QA might reject immediately and features that cannot be tested.
In the presentation we will demonstrate how we are able to deliver daily builds which focus on quality. We will demonstrate the method that keeps the QA busy, but not spending time on validating the features that are not working at all.

It minimizes the gap that might be created between Dev features and QA’s ability to verify them.
 In this session we will share multiple perspective on this solution:  DevOps group manager, the DevOps engineering leader and the Product architect (R&D).
