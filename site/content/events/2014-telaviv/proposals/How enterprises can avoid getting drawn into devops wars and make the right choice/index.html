title: "How enterprises can avoid getting drawn into devops wars and make the right choice"
---

**Abstract:**

Large enterprises today are pacing a flood of multiple devops tools to choose from for their infrastructure.
The problem intensifies when you have dozens of devops teams across the world, each with his own background of devops tools and knowledge and each with his own agenda of pushing to use his tools.
How would you leverage this distributed, disconnected knowledge into a single working devops knowledge source, and common infrastructure to leverage the whole enterprise?
Come and hear about Red Hat Global CI initiative to hear on one possible approach for taking on the battle.
