---

**Abstract:**

Through the ages, people have struggled to define Quality. It can be as lofty as a discussion of character, of excellence, of a superior way of every aspect coming together in elegant balance — or it can be just about something being good or bad. To put it simply, Quality is an imprecise concept.


**Speakers:**
