title: "What science tells us about information infrastructure"
---

**Abstract:**

A high level talk about what is weak about the way we currently run infrastructure, how to think in systems, how to deal with scale and complexity using real scientific methods (instead of guesswork). And finally, why "APIs will be our undoing" and why devops is crucial to the success of infrastructure in the future.

**Speaker:**

Mark Burgess
