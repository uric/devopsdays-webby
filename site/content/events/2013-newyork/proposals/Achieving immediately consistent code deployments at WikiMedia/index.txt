title: "Achieving immediately consistent code deployments at WikiMedia"
---

**Abstract:**

WikiMedia overview
- Best known for Wikipedia but also runs infrastructure for more than a dozen other Web properties
- Massive, complex Web-scale environment
- About 10,000,000,000 page views per year
- 20,000 new articles per day

WikiMedia continuous code deployment
- In most configuration management systems quality code deployment is impossible because it is eventually consistent (not real-time), but the system Ryan put in production at WikiMedia uses Salt and is immediately consistent (near real-time). The bulk of the talk will be focused on this aspect of the implementation...how to achieve immediately consistent configuration management and code deployment.
- Continuous code deployment also using Salt, Git, Redis, a deployment system using peer calls and a web server.

Other uses for Salt:
- First used SaltStack for remote execution, command and control of servers.
- Configuration management and code deployment;
- Doing other cool things with OpenStack and LDAP management.
