title: "DevOps vs The Enterprise - Ignite"
---

**Abstract:**

On the off chance I'm not selected for a major speaking slot :) I have developed an Ignite version. It's less formal. More fun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tongue in cheek look at the traditionally uncomfortable relationship between DevOps and the Enterprise. In my 5 minutes I shall comprehensively/controversially answer the following burning questions.

How does the Enterprise view the DevOps movement?

What does the DevOps movement think of the Enterprise?

Can ITIL and DevOps coexist?

What happens when an Enterprise lets monkeys loose in its datacenter?

Why can't we all be friends?

Who is this person and why did the organisers give him a microphone?

So turn on, strap in, and prepare to be schooled.

**Speaker:**

Alan Sharp-Paul
