**Abstract:**

Software product development has seen the change from various legacy SDLC to lean development via agile and DevOps methodology. DevOps methodology enables communication and strong collaboration among all stakeholders like developers, testers and customers. The 'one team' approach' provides continuous delivery/ integration keeping stakeholders feedback in mind. My session will focus on the challenges and benefits of adapting DevOps as a practice in our product development, from planning a release to fast paced sprint execution, close collaboration between development, test/QA, documentation team, management and customers, challenges like external dependencies if open source code is involved (openstack), continuous integration/delivery and benefits of this approach like enabling to integrate customer requirements during release by continuous feedback, focus on test automation to reach a successful final release of product.

DevOps integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating workflows and continuously measuring application performance.
