title: "A Benefits – Driven approach to practically identify a DevOps “point of launch” in Enterprise."
---

**Abstract:**

As our client - a global Telecoms organisation - embarked on their journey to adopt DevOps, the key question they asked of us was: “How to practically Start?”. Although an end-to-end view with a phased approach is always the consensus when implementing DevOps in an enterprise, the exact, practical starting point is always a debatable detail.

This case will present an approach to answer this important question (How to practically Start?) in a global enterprise where financial governance requires a benefits-driven approach to demonstrate business value and a business case to be approved.

We will talk about our experience & insights in building a benefits case for DevOps based on tangible business value using methodologies like activity-based accounting and priority criteria to help identify a platform or project to be the “point of launch” for DevOps and then decide which phase in the IT lifecycle is best to start with first – ensuring the bigger picture of DevOps in the enterprise is not lost into the details.
