title: "DevOps is not enough / DevOps leads to Disruptive Innovation?"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps is a condition for business agility. It flourishes in a collaborative and sharing environment. DevOps in Name Only (DINO) is lurking when the organization puts constraints, gates and other ‘pre-DevOps’ constructs. The early adopters feel the benefits and move fast forward. The basic questions are: will the laggards catch up, do they need to?
Follow this talk if you think ahead of the first DevOps wave, if you focus on the really hard-to-change part, viz. business culture change to help the early and late majority improve. Will DevOps itself help these organisations?
