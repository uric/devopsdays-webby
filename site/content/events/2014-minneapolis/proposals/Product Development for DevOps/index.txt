title: "Product Development for DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Product and customer development for the operations and engineering crowd is a different animal than in the consumer or enterprise space. While there is lots of overlap, such as the importance of product-market fit and focusing your product vision, the trends of automation, collaboration, and integrated workflows create some unique opportunities and pitfalls for software companies operating in the devops space.                               
                                                                                
Specifics:                                                                      
                                                                                
   When creating user personas, take their technical ability into account. Can your users code? Are they easily frustrated, or are they used to complex documentation?                                                       
                                                                                
   If you're selling to devops companies, assume you'll be part of an automated workflow. API coverage is key, and this includes good API documentation.                                                               
   Track and share the extensions, libraries, workarounds, and other add-ons that your users create. Use those as part of the product discovery process.
