title: "Transforming DevOps with Docker"
---

** Abstract:**

A number of inefficiencies exist in the software development workflow at most companies. A major contributor is inconsistencies in different environments as code moves from a developer's machine to build, staging, and production environments. You hear frequent complaints like - “ But it works on my machine”.
 
We moved to a Docker based process a few months ago, where Docker containers are integrated into the development workflow right from the time code is written on a developer’s machine to the time it is deployed into production. As a result, we can avoid environment conflicts, save on ops effort and costs, and ship features faster with better quality.

We will present our tips and tricks on how to containerize your DevOps workflow and ship features painlessly and often.
