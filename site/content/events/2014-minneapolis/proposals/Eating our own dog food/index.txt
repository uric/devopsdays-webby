title: "Eating our own dog food---DevOps at Compuware"
---

**Abstract:**

If you glance over the schedules of DevOps tracks at conferences, you get the impression that the topic is mostly focused on running large-scale web sites-but is that the truth? While we as a software company provide a number of products, this session is not about what we offer-it's about how we managed to adopt a DevOps mentality across our development, testing and operations teams. We talk about the process of getting there, the challenges we encountered along the way, and how we measure success.
