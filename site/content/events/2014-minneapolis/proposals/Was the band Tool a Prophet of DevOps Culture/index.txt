title: "Was the band Tool a Prophet of DevOps Culture?"
---

**Abstract:**

Given the premise of a component of legal theory in the United States, I will take you on a whirlwind tour that demonstrates how Tool may have been a Prophet of DevOps culture, both describing the problem that corporate culture creates, and like any good prophesy, the solution to avoiding doom. (No animal sacrifices required.)
