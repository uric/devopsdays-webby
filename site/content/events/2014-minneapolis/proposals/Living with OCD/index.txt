title: "Living with OCD"

**Abstract:**

Hi, I'm Seth Vargo, and I have OCD. But is that a bad thing? I continuously struggle with misplaced pointers, poorly indented code, unorganized resources, design decisions, and tests. I considered medication until I realized all the awesome things my OCD does too! Do I actually have a problem? Learn how my OCD shaves 11 minutes from each grocery trip and helps me spot anomalies and anti-patterns! Join me on an adventure as I teach you how to weaponize your obsessive compulsive disorder, if "disorder" is even the right word...
