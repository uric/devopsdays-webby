**Abstract:**

BAs DevOps has grown, many people ask "Qu'est-ce que DevOps?" The attempt to define devops brings about a visceral reaction from some and a curious reaction from others. But let's talk about DevOps in a different context. Let's talk about DevOps from the perspective of an American trying to learn French. In this talk I will cover the challenges many organizations face when approaching DevOps, and compare it to my (poor) journey of trying to learn French (and my attempts at using French when visiting France.) While for many French is ingrained, & for other's it is a journey. And so it is with DevOps. I'll specifically focus on the language we use within the DevOps community, and why it is important when trying to bring DevOps to a larger community.
