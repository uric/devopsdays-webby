**Abstract:**

A guided tour of a modern continuous delivery process, along with the benefits and challenges it presents.
I’m a visual person, when I started out with build and release engineering and agile, charged with reducing cycle time I wanted a holistic view of the current system and a path to tackling the issues. This is my story of working to create pipelines for consistent and high quality software delivery systems.

We’ll cover:

* value stream mapping
* identifying constraints
* connections, tools and integrations


**Speaker:**

*Steve Pereira*

I'm a software delivery specialist in Toronto, helping companies and teams more effectively and efficiently ship code. I run Toronto's monthly DevOps meetup and ran Toronto's first DevOps Days conference last Sept. I'm unreasonably fond of throwing frisbees and a giant fan of all things software.
