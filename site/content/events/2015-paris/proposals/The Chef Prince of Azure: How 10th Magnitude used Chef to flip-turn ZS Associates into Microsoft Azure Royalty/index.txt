title: "The Chef Prince of Azure: How 10th Magnitude used Chef to flip-turn ZS Associates into Microsoft Azure Royalty"
platinum: true
---

**Abstract:**
 

Now, this is a story all about how<br />
ZS got flipped-turned upside down<br />
And I'd like to take a minute<br />
Just sit right back,<br />
I'll tell you how we used Chef on the Microsoft stack<br />


--<br />
Come hear the rap on how ZS Associates, a Global Sales and Marketing Data Firm, massively accelerated their change velocity and eradicated manual config errors by implementing Chef on Azure. Hear about ZS’s cool end-to-end provisioning process that uses Powershell and Chef to automate deploy, config and test with one button. 

10th Magnitude Consultant and Arrested DevOps Podcast co-host Trevor Hess will take you through the implementation verse by verse. Trevor, by the way, will literally be rapping--with props to Will Smith.
