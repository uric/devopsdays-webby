**Abstract:**

Britain has a long history of manufacturing, and whilst the decline of the sector is well documented, applying the basic principles of traditional manufacturing to the “whitecollar” office environment is the new manufacturing. This talk will take you through the basic building patterns of manufacturing, looking at vendor selection/audits, the QA process, understanding of basic costings, discovering if the “products” are low volume, High mix, or low mix high volume and what the implications of design for manufacture would be in such an environment. Also, how to apply these basic patterns to the modern software driven “Office ” world. This is part one of a two part talk, the second one being “Preparing the Enterprise for Manufacturing”.
