**Abstract:**

Current devops rely on correctly and consistently configured network
devices. Managing these from a central place and have them configured to
your operational and organisational standards is a challenge in particular
in a multi vendor environment.

This presentation will show how by using NetMRI you can leverage a policy
engine to evaluate config files in your network and automate the
resolution after detection of any of these issues. It will also showcase
how to automate tasks across your network.


We will then address the issue and showcase some examples of other possible network automation tasks.

**Speaker:**
