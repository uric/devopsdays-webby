**Abstract:**

Imagine a world where infrastructure and platform services blend together in one seamless experience, so developers and IT professionals no longer have to work in disparate environments in the Cloud. The combined use of the Cloud and DevOps is one of the keys to the successful implementation of this vision through automated provisioning and configuration of environments, tests or deployments, or release management. Our objective with this ignite talk is to try to review some of these Cloud DevOps processes and of course, to have some fun.
