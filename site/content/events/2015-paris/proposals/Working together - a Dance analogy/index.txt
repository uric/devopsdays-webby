**Abstract:**

Dancing is a wonderful activity, that can be done alone, in couple or in large groups.

To be efficient (or to avoid chaos), learning to dance helps, as well as caring for others and following rules. A lot like teamwork actually. This ignite will unravel this dancing analogy to teamworking in IT, and hightlight how devops is just a part of successful strategies applied in other domains to reach top level.

I am co-founder of Normation, the company behind the open source IT automation and compliance solution Rudder. In charge of professional services, a bit developer and a bit sysadmin at Normation, I also love to dance in my free time.
