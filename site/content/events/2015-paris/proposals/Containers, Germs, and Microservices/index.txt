**Abstract:**

This presentation is loosely based on Jared Diamonds Pulitzer Prize winning
nonfiction "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies".  The concept
that certain gaps in power and technology between human societies originate in
environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback
loops.

In this presentation we will first level set on the core definitions of
Containers and Microservices.  We will also discuss another technology called
Data Gravity and how the convergence of the three will create a positive
feedback loop that will change how we do computing. Of course, Devops and
culture will be a core theme to this presentation and an attempt will be made
to conclude a consistent tie back to the aforementioned title of this
presentation.
