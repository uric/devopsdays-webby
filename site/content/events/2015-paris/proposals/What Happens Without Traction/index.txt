**Abstract:**

What if you're not the CTO and you want to improve your quality, performance and stability.

This is my story of working within low buy-in, legacy, siloed organizations to break down barriers, blur borders and eliminate constraints. I’ll also tie in material from ‘Driving Technical Change’ and ‘Building a DevOps Culture’

We’ll cover:

* tribes and guilds vs teams
* winning trust and building confidence
* simple risk and roi
* low impact tools

**Speaker:**

*Steve Pereira*

I'm a software delivery specialist in Toronto, helping companies and teams more effectively and efficiently ship code. I run Toronto's monthly DevOps meetup and ran Toronto's first DevOps Days conference last Sept. I'm unreasonably fond of throwing frisbees and a giant fan of all things software.
