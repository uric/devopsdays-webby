platinum: true
---

**Abstract:**

I'm talking about a huge worldwide project, with massive metrics : million of user accounts, 40 countries, complex features, 30+ developers (symfony, solr, varnish, talend), AWS team, 1000+ behat tests, etc.

Everything was done with the best practices : test driven (1000+ behat tests), continuous integration, dedicated devOps team, etc... BUT we also delivered the chinese portal version, and so everything changed ! Forget all that you learnt, be mistaken your certainties, throws your marks, be allowed surprise !
* No more... familiar browsers (also none on browserstack)
* No more... alphabetic language (& so alphabetic sort ?)
* No more... trustable network
* No more... trustable DNS
* No more... trustable analytics
* No more... AWS

This talk will tell you the story of this exotic trip, and how we resolved most of the issues,
