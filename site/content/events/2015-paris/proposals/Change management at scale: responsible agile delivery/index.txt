**Abstract:**

The dynamics that the devops culture bring to teams and organizations challenges the traditional process associated with software delivery.

In this talk we'll explore how to please the ITIL and ISO gods while maintaining an environment which enables fast release cycles and negligeable friction for engineering teams.

We will review the two main traditional constructs that are expected from IT service management frameworks: the change acceptance board and configuration management database and see how a lean process can be carried out to maintain a similar approach without introducing unfamiliar tools or methodology to engineers.
