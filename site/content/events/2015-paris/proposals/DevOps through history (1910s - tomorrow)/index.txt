**Abstract:**

DevOps came to life only a few years ago, but the thought behind it can be traced back to the early 20th century.

In this presentation, I will try to show how the different big industry metologies have influenced what DevOps is and, after looking in my crystal ball, I will try to get a glimpse of what's coming next.

**Speaker:**
