**Abstract:**

Git-deliver is a portable, GPL licensed delivery system based on Git.

It uses "git push" combined with SSH as a way of delivering a project (as of a specific Git commit) to various environments (Git remotes) simply and securely. It also helps keeping track of what is delivered on which server, and ensures integrity.

It is ideal for delivering dynamic language projects and server configuration files.
