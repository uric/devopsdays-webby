**Abstract:**

With the new "Apps economy", applications are now at the heart of the business opportunities related to digital. To meet the expectations of the market, these applications have to be developed and deployed always faster, and, in the same time, to support high availability and scalability requirements. In this context, setting up a DevOps approach is a real asset. The Cloud is another accelerator of this phenomenon, as the combined use of the Cloud and DevOps is therefore one of the keys to the successful implementation of a continuous delivery process. Automated provisioning and configuration of environments, tests or deployments, release management, are a few examples of DevOps processes to be implemented, but it's clearly not enough to deploy so-called tools DevOps to make DevOps real. DevOps is not a monolithic entity so there must be a reflection on the organization and the impact of the DevOps on departments, teams. Moreover, companies are not all equal before DevOps. When an IT practice has built its approach to operational management on a model not conducive to intra-services collaboration, there will be more difficulty to adopt a DevOps approach. The evolution must be progressive in setting priorities to target processes whose impact will be most visible. The approach must be pragmatic and controlled. This accompaniment to change is one of the more difficult step to carry out. Our objective with this session is to share our experiences at Alter Way and Microsoft, on how to implement DevOps in organizations, by defining DevOps assessment and roadmap considering a DevOps maturity model, evolving engineering organizations, enabling continuous and rapid flow of value by breaking down functional silos, facilitating continuous learning through data-driven design and the elimination of non-value adding activities, rationalization of resource use, and de-risking work.
