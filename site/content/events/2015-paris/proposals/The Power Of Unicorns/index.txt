**Abstract:**

Every body loves unicorns, mostly because they are awesome but in the DevOps world, unicorns represent those companies which have embraced DevOps to the fullest and took it to the next level. 

They're named that way because they are so rare and it all seems like they're doing magic when they're just doing what everyone should be doing: DevOps the right way.
