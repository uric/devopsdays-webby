## Travel

### Air
Paris is a major European air hub.  All major world carriers and alliances operate (often multiple) daily flights.

There are two airports that service Paris:

* [Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG / LFPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport)
* [Paris Orly Airport (ORY / LFPO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly_Airport)

In general, CDG handles larger planes and longer distances, but there are exceptions. Both airports are equally accessible from the city by public transport and private car or taxi.

### Rail
Paris is a major European rail hub and is well served by high-speed (TGV) rail links from across Europe.  For example, if you're travelling from (or to) London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Geneva, or Zurich, on the whole it is faster to take the train than to fly.

### Public Transportation
Paris has mature public transportation infrastructure including a massive métro (subway) system, buses, and tramways. Tickets can be purchased from machines at any métro station using money or bank cards.

## Accommodation

Paris is a surprisingly compact place - it's possible to <em>walk</em> across the entire width of the city in about two hours.  Paris is also one of the most visited cities on the planet, and as such, has an incredibly high density of hotels.  Furthermore, due to the highly efficient métro system, one is never more than 30 minutes from anywhere else (often less).

Practically speaking, there is an [Ibis](http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-9525-ibis-styles-paris-massena-olympiades/index.shtml) literally around the corner from the venue, but any hotel within five métro stops means a commute of under 10 minutes total.  In other words: the choice is yours!  Bring the family and make a vacation out of it, if you like!
