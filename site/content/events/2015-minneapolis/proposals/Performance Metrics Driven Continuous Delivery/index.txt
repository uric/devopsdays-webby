title: "Performance Metrics Driven Continuous Delivery"
---

**Abstract:**

As organizations move towards implementing DevOps related concepts one of the building blocks is typically a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipeline. Traditional processes revolve around simple functional tests with Boolean pass/fail and do not encompass non-functional elements. This can result in more rollbacks as code is deployed that may be functionally sound but unstable or non-performant.

In this talk we will show you how to automatically capture and report on key performance and scalability metrics (such as # of SQL Queries, time spent in components, # of resources on a page) through every stage of your deployment pipeline.

Tracking these metrics across all stages and comparing them between builds will help ensure higher quality releases and ensure something like a database killing bug does not make it all the way into production! 

Less time spent rolling back suboptimal releases means more time spent delivering new features and happier customers.
