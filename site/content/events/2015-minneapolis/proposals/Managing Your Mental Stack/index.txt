**Abstract:**

It's information overload these days -- how can a technology professional manage to keep up with everything that is new and exciting in the world of DevOps? What are the best methods for absorbing content and developing skills?  Just how useful are podcasts, anyway?                                          
                                                                                
In this talk (inspired by an episode of my [Podcast Name] podcast) I will share strategies for consuming information about techniques, concepts, and stories about DevOps. I will include practical methods for acquiring information, managing intake of blogs, articles, and studies, and absorbing and synthesizing this information in an applicable way.
