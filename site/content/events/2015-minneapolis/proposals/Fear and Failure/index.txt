title: "Fear & Failure"
---

**Abstract:**

Fear & Failure is a soft talk (with no technical content), discussing imposter syndrome, fear of failure, and how to combat them; I follow this up with a discussion on ways to cope with inevitable failure and benefit from it. This talk was inspired by one I saw at the Madison Ruby conference last year, "What Stuttering Taught Me About Marketing", which triggered a lot of self-reflection about why I let my fears hold me back personally and professionally.
