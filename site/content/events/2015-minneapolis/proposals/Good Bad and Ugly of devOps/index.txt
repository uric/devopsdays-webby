title: "Good, Bad and Ugly of devOps - A case study of cloud delivery pipeline"
---

**Abstract:**
Continuous delivery in the cloud requires infrastructure that enables everyone to deliver "good" code any time. In order to build a delivery pipeline infrastructure which can throw bad code you need to build right cloud deployment tools and change management process. Essentially, there are three main stages of a pipeline - image baking stage, acceptance stage and production stage. Code should move through these stages with a trusted infrastructure which can validate for quality, resiliency and security. This talk will showcase real case study of successful cloud deployment pipeline developed by IBM Cloud data services team. I will also talk about some radical ideas of Runbook automation, monitoring and log analytics.
