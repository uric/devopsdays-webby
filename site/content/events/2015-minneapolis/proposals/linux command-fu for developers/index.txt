title: "linux command-fu for developers"
---

**Abstract:**

As a developer, for years I wrote code in a graphical IDE on Windows or a Mac.  I have written hundreds of thousands of lines likely to only click a button to compile, build, deploy locally or even push to repositories. Coming from the development side of the house I regularly feel like a fraud when working with the system.  I have had this feeling before, since I didn't study computer science in school.  I will cover techniques I used to ramp up quickly on system commands and string together my favorite commands to understand a system quickly.  Even experienced system admins will likely get an interesting tidbit or 2.
