title: "Building SaaS Applications on AWS"
---

**Abstract:**

The software industry is rapidly moving to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Compared to traditionally licensed software, SaaS greatly shortens release cycles, significantly shrinks support costs, and allows publishers to reach the global market. As part of this agile evolution, more and more developers are choosing to create their SaaS products in the public cloud. This talk will introduce the experienced web developer to building a highly-scalable, self-healing SaaS application on Amazon Web Services. Some of the things you'll take back to work: The business reasons for building a SaaS product over an installed product, the scalability and security challenges introduced by serving thousands of customers from a single instance of an application, and the different tenancy models and the tradeoffs of each.
