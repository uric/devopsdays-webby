title: "How to Teach DevOps with Cookies"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps can optimize any process that results in an artifact by applying lessons learned from manufacturing and agile software development. Unfortunately not many people firmly understand how either industry works, never mind both of them. Come learn how using a cookie company as a model for devOps provides an example that anyone can grasp.                           
                                                                                
When dealing with a new concept it's often convenient to have a base case example to fall back to for reference. In this presentation you'll learn how to teach devOps with cookies by working as a group to apply devOps models like CALMS, ICE, and the Three Ways to our cookie company as that base case reference. Not only are cookies and the baking process a good instructional aid for explaining devOps methodologies and concepts, but the snacks encourage the collaboration needed to work through difficult conversations and problems as well.
