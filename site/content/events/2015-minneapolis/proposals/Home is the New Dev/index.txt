title: "Home is the New Dev"
---

**Abstract:**

Running a homelab is a great way to keep your skills fresh and direct your career trajectory. It's easy to get bogged down by all of the work that you already have in your day job, but using the things you learn on the job and applying it in the form of a fun hobby extends your skillset and keeps you flexible when approaching problems in the real working world.                   
                                                                                
In your day job, it can be difficult to get new technologies implemented as there can be perceived risks such as lack of knowledge across your team, new tech not necessarily being fully proven, or just a general unwillingness to change. This does not have to be where the conversation around new technology ends. With effective projects in your home that model some of the ways that you wish your work environment was structured, you get to fully run through your implementation strategy across multiple arenas.             

You become your own dev, ops, QA, and architecture team. You call the shots and get to see what the pain points will be for each and every one of these organizations. Additionally, you expand your skillset to more than just the niche areas you cover normally in your day to day work. Gaining this insight is invaluble and allows you to explore well outside of the normal bounds you would encounter typically in your day job. You make mistakes at home, take responsibility for them without fear or judgement and correct your path. You iterate, learn, develop and gain insight into how to approach problems all without needing any approval. Plus you get to have a little bit of fun doing it.
