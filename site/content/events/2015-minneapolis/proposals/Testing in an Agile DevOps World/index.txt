title: "Testing in an Agile DevOps World"
---

**Abstract:**

Type:Moderated General Discussion 

Description:

 This session would focus on how testing changes in an agile DevOps world.Discussion points would include:

 What is the best combination of white box, grey box, and black box testing? 
 Should there be separate test teams and what testing should they own? 
 Is there still a concept of System Test in an Agile DevOps world?  
If so, how does it change? When and how should Accessibility, Usability, and Performance testing be done?
 How does customer usage (A/B testing or Beta testing) fit into the Agile DevOps world?



 I would provide the following to start the discussion: 
 Generally accepted definitions of white box, grey box, and black box testing 
 Working models of agile testing in a DevOps world (a couple of views that can be discussed) 
 Breakdown of what is typically done during System Test so we can discuss what is still needed 
 Breakdown of the other type of testing (Accessibility, Usability, Performance, and so on) so we can discuss when and how this should be done
