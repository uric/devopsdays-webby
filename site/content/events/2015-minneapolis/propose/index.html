<b>Call for proposals is now closed.<br>
Selected proposals will be announced by the 1st of May.
</center>

### Please consider [commenting on proposals submitted by others](../proposals/)!

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.
