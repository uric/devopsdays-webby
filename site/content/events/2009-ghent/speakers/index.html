Chris Read is an Infrastructure Specialist at ThoughtWorks Inc., where he helps clients design and impliment their production infrastructure, and make the process of deploying their software as painless as possible. He is one of the creators of Buildix: an integrated development environment that helps projects get started quickly.

Specializing in Unix environments, he uses his experience from both sides of the wall to help admins and developers realize they're both playing for the same team

Mattias has experience in bringing both developers and operations closer together. During one of his projects he saw that both devs and operations needed to be equally involved in problem solving and a lot of the work spent was towards breaking down the barriers preventing this to happen.

He is currently finishing a book about the experiences from implementing Kanban in operations, hopefully it will be available electronically by the end of July.
