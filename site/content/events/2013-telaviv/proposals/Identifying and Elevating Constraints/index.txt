title: "Identifying and Elevating Constraints while Transforming Coercive Systems/Procedures into Enabling Systems/Procedures"
---

**Abstract:**
 
In the second decade of the 21st century, DevOps is meeting the challenges of rapid architectural change, cloud computing, new devices, virtualization, configuration management and the need for automatic deployment and continuous integration by empowering development and operations to synergize with each other. As both a cultural and technological shift in how IT systems are managed from cradle to grave, DevOps emphasizes communication, collaboration and integration between all stakeholders and beneficiaries.  In this session, Chaim Cohen will demonstrate how DevOps is changing sacrosanct operations fundamentals while promoting flexible and elastic computing environments. He will analyze the culture of fingerpointing; focus on the integration of equipment, people and policy; display processes for ongoing improvement; show how to identify and elevate constraints; exhibit how to transform Coercive Systems/Procedures into Enabling Systems/Procedures; and demonstrate how to promote agility over raw power decision-making in “observe-orient-decide-act” cycles that supports quick, effective and proactive decision-making.
