title: "DevOps and Security: It’s Happening. Right Now"
---

**Abstract:**

How do you integrate security within a Continuous Deployment (CD) environment - where every 5 minutes a feature, an enhancement, or a bug fix needs to be released? Traditional application security tools which require lengthy periods of configuration, tuning and application learning have become irrelevant in these fast-pace environments. Yet, falling back only on the secure coding practices of the developer cannot be tolerated.
Secure coding requires a new approach where security tools become part of the development environment – and eliminate any unnecessary code analysis overhead. By collaborating with development teams, understanding their needs and requirements, you can pave the way to a secure deployment in minutes. Steps include:
* Re-evaluate existing security tools and consider their integration within a CD environment
* Deliver a secured development framework and enforce its usage
* Pinpoint precise security code flaws and provide optimal fix recommendations"
