title: "Monitoring Patterns with Riemann"
---

**Abstract:**

[Riemann](http://riemann.io) aggregates events from your servers and applications with a powerful stream processing language, which enables concise monitoring rule declarations.
This 5 minute ignite talk gives a taste of common monitoring pattern implementations: heartbeat, statistics, event enrichment, state based filters, multi-tenant monitoring, and reviews what you can do with Riemann after processing these patterns. 

**Speaker:**
