title: "DevOps - not just for SaaS startups"
---

**Abstract:**
 
Based on what we see in startups/small companies that move towards DevOps culture/operation we see great potential for improving the life and results of developers, testers, operations and business people alike. 
But for those people in big legacy enterprise organizations, especially IT units serving internal organizations, this sounds like a crazy dream. Their organization is light years behind even simple agility not to speak about devops.
In this session we will examine why these large organizations are struggling with agile and will struggle with devops, analyze the situation using models such as the Moore's ""chasm"" and look at some successes we (AgileSparks consultants) had in evolving legacy IT organizations towards higher and higher agility, culminating in DevOps and CD as a vision. We will share concrete tips/tricks from industry success stories as well as our own ""Way"" of making this happen. 
You will be exposed to concepts like Kanban, Dynamic Feature Teams, The relation between DevOps and LeanStartup/MVP/Complexity Thinking, and get some concrete ideas to try back home to start your journey towards DevOps or to convince your legacy IT friend that DevOps is not just for pure SaaS companies.
