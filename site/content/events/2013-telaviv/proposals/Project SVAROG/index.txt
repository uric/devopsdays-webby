**Abstract:**
 
The most important piece of continuous delivery chain is the component that delivers code from the code repository to environment passing stages like checkout, compilation, packaging, testing, publishing and deployment. SVAROG is the project the is going to cover that.
SVAROG was born in SoftServeâ€™s DevOps Lab as a BASH-based tool to clean the mess with deployment but (as it usually happens J) became as widely used tool within the company.
