title: "Doing more with logs: logs as streams of data"
---

**Abstract:**

Usually people refer to their logs when they want to debug a problem or understand what happened last night. But logs can be a very versatile and portable stream of data, that can be used for far more than just debugging.

In this talk we will explore how to switch from treating logs as collection of files to a stream of data and practices to extract useful information from your logs. We will review real world examples of doing analytics using logs, performance monitoring and more.
