**Abstract:**

A learning organization must leverage success/failure events as a trigger for a take-in session. Drilling down to the root cause of the event is a key to introduce corrective actions that can improve the way the organization is doing business. In this short session I will provide the incentive and technique that makes it an effective tool.
