title: "Keep DevOps Hip!"
---

**Abstract:**

At a time when DevOps is becoming more prominent and mainstream, many efforts exist to define, restrict, and scope what DevOps is and is not. I'd argue that DevOps is not a checklist but rather a movement that should keep evolving. It's all about the energy it creates in people and the drive in continuous exploration and improvement it nurtures (which is never ending by definition).
