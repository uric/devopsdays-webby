title: "Why Ops Need to Embrace DevOps Culture"
---

**Abstract:**

So many organizations are having trouble understanding what the DevOps culture is, and how to apply it in technology and process.

This is a primer on how companies and individuals have had success building their DevOps practices beginning with the Ops team.

We cover:

+ Building micro-orgs beginning with yourself
+ Understanding the value to you and your org
+ Technology examples

Mostly, we cover how to always find success, even with partial adoption of DevOps practices. As a Systems Architect with 20 years in Financial Services data centers, Eric brings a host of proven experience in building out orchestration teams and creating cultural change in IT organizations.
