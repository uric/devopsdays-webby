title: "Is this the end of traditional configuration management?"
---

**Abstract:**

The concept of using images for provisioning servers has been around for ages. Containers, and more specifically Docker, are putting a new spin on this old idea and lowering the bar for all users. Traditional configuration management is having a hard time fitting into this new age.

This talk is a story on our journal into exploring containers and Docker as a potential replacement for configuration management for managing large clusters.
