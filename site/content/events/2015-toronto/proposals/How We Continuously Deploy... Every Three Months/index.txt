title: "How We Continuously Deploy... Every Three Months"
---

**Abstract:**

We love continuous deployment, DevOps and automation of all the things.

And then one day we decided to build a user-facing product that is installed on-premise by our clients - large telecoms and network providers (cue old-fashioned stack of installation floppies).

So we pursue rapid iteration on UX delight, new features, bugfixes, but ultimately run up against a 3-month upgrade cycle executed by external admin staff who can't even give us access to their system (for legal/audit reasons).

This talk outlines some of our approaches in tackling that, and how they apply to not just on-premise software installations, but also companies and projects that are transitioning to the DevOps philosophy.

**Speaker:**
