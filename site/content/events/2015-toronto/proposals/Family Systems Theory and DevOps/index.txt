title: "Family Systems Theory and DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Family Systems Theory is a huge topic inside of the already broad topic of psychology. There’s no way to cover it in 5 minutes… or is there? How might Family Systems Theory apply to this wild and crazy trend of DevOps? Could we be leading our DevOps efforts fundamentally wrong? This unique choose-your-own-adventure style Ignite talk will leave you questioning your own leadership and management methods and piquing your interest in becoming a well-differentiated leader.

Focus:

+ What it means to be a well-differentiated leader
+ A story of the effects of being a well-differentiated leader
+ Not stooping to the level of the least performant
+ Not being a data-head - being courageous and picking a direction instead of being wishy washy, waiting for the perfect answer
+ DevOps should not be just an empathy-centric movement

Ideas taken shamelessly from Edwin Friedman’s book: “Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix”

**Speaker:**
