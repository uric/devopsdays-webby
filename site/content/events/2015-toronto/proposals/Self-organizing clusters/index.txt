title: "Self-organizing clusters"
---

**Abstract:**

"Servers that management themselves." Just a pipe dream. Or is it?

This talk is a story about exploring concepts of self-organizing clusters using Docker, systemd, and CoreOS. It will go over an approach for building an auto-updating, auto-patching, self-balanced, and redundant cluster. It will even address the problem of the “data persistence” that Docker doesn't seem to solve, but is necessary for data stores.

**Speaker:**

Hany Fahim
