<h3>Don't take anything for granted</h3>

<hr>

Over the five years, we've come a long way: we get a lot of submissions that are refinements and/or testimonials of the traditional devops topics: infrastructure as code, kanban, large enterprise, continuous delivery ... Obviously we value these topics very much. But, this would not be the anniversary edition, if we want to give this a new twist: we want you to expand yours and other people's minds by suggesting speakers/topics are not traditionally suggested. We especially welcome suggestions with relation to other scientific fields.

In short **blow our brains aways** by suggesting something radically new.

Besides the suggest a speaker/topic we also have the traditional ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minute slots that will have all people's full attention as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>: these are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Openspace session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during the openspace opening. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">openspace format</a> for more information
</ol>

<h3>Speaker selection</h3>
The selection is done by the [complete organization team](../contact) over a discussion.
We take into account comments/remarkts done at the bottom of each proposal.
Once selection is done, we will notify both selected and non selected speakers. 
Optionally we will tell people they are a runner up or ask them to propose the same subject as an Ignite talk.

<h3>Suggest a speaker, topic</h3>
Come on, don't be shy. We know you've always wanted a person to give their own view on a specific subject.
Now's your chance and we might make it happen.
