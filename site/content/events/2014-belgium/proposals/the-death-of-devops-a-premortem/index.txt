title: "The Death of Devops: A Premortem"
---

Imagine it's October, 2019. The headline on the front page of the Wall Street Journal reads:
"Devops, a once promising approach, finally proven ineffective". Or worse… What happened that got us here?

In this interactive session, I'll conduct a premortem to identify many of the things
that could prevent devops from reaching its full potential by harnessing the wisdom of
the assembled devops practitioners. We’ll then brainstorm solutions to these problems.
According to research, premortems help improve the accuracy of “prospective hindsight” by about 30%.

Dave Zwieback has been perfecting the art of looking busy at work for 18 years.
