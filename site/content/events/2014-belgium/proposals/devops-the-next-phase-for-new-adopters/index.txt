title: "DevOps – the next phase for new adopters"
---

So much has been learned and achieved in the past 5 years of DevOps:
culture, organization, process, and technologies. As more traditional, enterprise IT shops
start to enter and embrace the many elements of DevOps they are poised to be even more productive.

This talk will look at how Target’s IT organization has embraced the established DevOps patterns
to accelerate adoption, demonstrate wins in the early phases of the journey,
and discuss ideas on how to move more quickly in large traditional IT.
There is an emerging adoption pattern within Target that as new teams join the DevOps journey
they are able to move more quickly and become more productive faster
taking best practices, learnings, and patterns from the early days of the journey.
