title: "NetDevOps: No Compromises"
---
While DevOps culture has flourished, networking has missed out on the last 7 years or so of progress,
and still exists as a silo today. The scale of cloud networking has grown,
as well as the need for large and dynamically-changing virtual environments.
Many are looking to Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for answers,
but network automation has been defined as a business need from the cloud,
to the startup, to the Enterprise network.

If these automation solutions don't align with everything we've learned,
we not only miss out on leveraging some of the best ideals that DevOps has brought to the table,
but we risk creating another field that is disconnected from our efforts.

Networking doesn't have to be left out, and NetDevOps can share the same practices
and tooling that we've come to know and love. In this talk, we will explore
the myths and challenges associated with cultivating network automation the DevOps way,
and how we can leverage our existing efforts. We'll not only discuss how existing tools
and methodologies can benefit networking, but we will also talk about the ways
to develop for a network in a virtual environment, without needing any actual network hardware.

John Deatherage is the Automation Architect for Juniper's Security Business Unit,
where he helps develop solutions for Cloud Builders and High IQ Networks.
He believes that traditional walls between networking, development, operations,
and systems will continue to break down, and that the power of collaboration
through DevOps culture will define how networks are built in the future.
