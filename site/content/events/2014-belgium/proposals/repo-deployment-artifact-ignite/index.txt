With the increase number of dependency between applications
and third-party packages, it is quite often that we find ourselves bury in
the dependency hell. In scenario like this, wouldn't it be great if we can
take a snapshot of the repository, version it and use it. Even better if we
can take cherry pick the required packages from the local repository and
third-party repository and create a snapshot of it so that we can share and
distribute the snapshot. This ignite talk will be able using a tool called
[aptly](http://www.aptly.info/) to achieve this goal.

Inny So is a consultant working in Thoughtworks Australia (currently on working on a project in London). She 
started off as a Java developer then slowly become interested in continuos
integration and delivery. She is especially interested in pipeline design and
what can done to reduce the feedback loop between code checkin to
production.
