title: "Engineering Ethos"
---
Examining the reality of ‘devops’ as a synonym for Engineering.
Looking at the benefits of slowing down instead of speeding up and how a return to
Engineering principals can help individuals, teams and businesses to deliver
better quality and set more realistic expectations in technology and beyond.
This is a talk about tooling up the minds of the human to leave the machine alone
to do what it’s really good at.

A solutions focused, positive, driven team player and leader,
ambitious with a record of technical excellence, commercial awareness and success.
I'm a total geek and proud of it! I'm a strong advocate of mission leadership
and promise theory when dealing with teams of complex personalities and passions.
I lead teams of highly skilled engineers in environments where the rate
of complex technical change is high and new technology adoption is encouraged.
