title: "Innovating at speed with Devops"
---
In this session we explain why we are convinced that a modern DevOps approach
is key to foster innovation. We start out with discussing the key elements of DevOps from a process,
people and infrastructure viewpoint. Next we look into a DevOps maturity model
which can be used to evaluate where your organization is currently at.
Based on that you can make a roadmap to attain the holy grail,
a world where you can fail fast and often to ensure you finally reach success.
And looking at history this is how many of the great human inventions came to life.

During a 20 year career at IBM Eric was involved with many customer projects of various sizes.
He has a long experience in all kind of development related technologies,
ranging from Mainframe environments till mobile and internet of things.
He has been involved in  aspects of modernizing existing environments as well as
in implementing new technologies. He has experience both with deep down development,
