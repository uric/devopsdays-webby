title: "5 years of metrics and monitoring"
---
5 years ago, monitoring was just beginning to emerge from the dark ages.

Since then there's been a cambrian explosion of tools, a rough
formalisation of how the tools should be strung together, the
emergence of the monitoringsucks meme, the transformation of
monitoringsucks into monitoringlove, and the rise of a sister
community around Monitorama.

Alert fatigue has become a concept that's entered the devops
consciousness, and more advanced shops along the monitoring continuum
are analysing their alerting data to help humans and machines work
better together.

But Nagios is still the dominant check executor. Plenty of sites still
use RRDtool. And plenty of people are still chained to their pagers,
with no relief in sight.

What's holding us back? What will the next 5 years look like? Will we
still be using Nagios? Have we misjudged our audience? What are our
biggest challenges?
