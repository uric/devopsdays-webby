title: "DevOps - Practices, Techniques and Tools for Continuous Delivery"
---
Can you tell which version of your software that is currently in production?
What is being approved? And who built it and when? If it was compiled using the right dependencies?
Which scripts were run? And who authorized its publication?
If it has been properly tested? It is running without any problem right now?
In this presentation will be demonstrated how to approach the development and operation teams,
how to establish practices, the benefits of using agile techniques and what tools are available
to provide an environment where development, management, test and operations can
communicate, collaborate, participate and evolve in the delivery of working software,
with quality and speed in an auditable way.
