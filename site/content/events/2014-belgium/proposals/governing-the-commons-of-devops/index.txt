About Sandy Flath:

and some programming Know How. The company I work for aims to bring DevOps into the C-Suite.
Thereby, pursuing to make companies aware of good practices to leverage the full potential of DevOps.
I’m a community exchange point at CA Technologies, making sure that CA Technologies stays
on top of the issues practitioner’s face: Where the struggle is and where success happens –
and most importantly: How and why.
