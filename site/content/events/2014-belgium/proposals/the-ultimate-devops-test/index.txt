title: "The ultimate DevOps test"
---

"Culture", "tearing down the silos", "continuous integration", "infrastructure orchestration", â€¦
Did DevOps fall into the buzzwords trap? Do some of us use certain terms mechanically,
just because everybody's doing it, without a 100% confidence we grasped their meaning?
Or, even worse: we are more than positive we got it, but we actually didn't?

Let's do a sanity check: will we be able to tell the difference
between sentences authored by actual people and a well-fed Markov chain text generator?
The condition of our community rests on our shoulders!

Marta Paciorkowska is a junior software engineer at [Three of Coins](http://3ofcoins.net),
a web operations consulting and services company. She likes Ruby, alleycats and vegan pizza.
She tries to actively work towards making programming communities
more inclusive, safer spaces, and is one of the ten funniest people she knows.
