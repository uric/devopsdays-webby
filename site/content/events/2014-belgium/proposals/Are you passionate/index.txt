A humorous Ignite/Pecha Kucha that argues for rationality in the workplace, rather than emotions and passion.

Seb Rose is an independent software developer, trainer and consultant based in the UK.

He first worked as a programmer in 1980 writing applications for estate agents and solicitors in compiled BASIC on an Apple II. He has worked with many mainstream technologies since then, for many well-known companies, such as Amazon, IBM, NCR, HBOS, Standard Life and Rabobank.  Now most of the code he writes is for open source projects, such as Cucumber and Cyber-Dojo.
