title: "Let's get serious about culture"
---
Over the last five years the halls of devopsdays events have reverberated that culture is one of the key legs devops stand on.  In this talk I propose we do a deep-dive in to key aspects of culture including an examination of the systems that it lives in. Is it possible to engineer culture the way we engineer data centers and large web platforms? And who are the different voices we can learn more from?

We will explore the following areas:

1. Which scientific disciplines contribute to our current understanding of culture
2. Can we "change" the culture of our organizations?
3. Will I have to hug everybody in my company?
4. What roles does tribalism play in our work culture?
5. Is culture the scapegoat for all of our human problems?
6. What is the role of experimentation in cultural evolution.?
7. A brief primer on complex adaptive human systems
8. How to know when to collaborate, cooperate and coordinate
