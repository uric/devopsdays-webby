title: "Mesos: Your datacenter as one computer"
---
As applications continue to move to public and private clouds,
our computing platform should no longer be treated as a tower of pizza boxes.
It spans multiple datacenters spread around the world.
That brings new challenges to the table to have all building blocks working in concerto,
in terms of balancing and plumbing. The Apache Mesos ecosystem provides an holistic approach
to this problem in order to deliver web scale performance.
Servers will be utilized more efficiently, complexity is reduced,
maintenance simplified resulting in a lower bill.
And how does it do that?
By treating your datacenter as one big computer.

Nils is a techie born and raised in Belgium.
He has a deep interest in developing applications in distributed environments.
After a short path as PhD researcher and consultant,
he wanted to work on his own product and co-founded WooRank with 2 friends,
taking the role of CTO. WooRank is a SaaS startup that builds tools for digital marketing agencies.
By grabbing and calculating millions of data points every day,
he developed a passion for automating, scaling and distributing large scale applications.
