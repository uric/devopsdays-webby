**Abstract:**

AWS cloud offers tremendous opportunities to tailor the infrastructure
to ones needs. It is possible to choose compute resources with varying
performance characteristics (e.g., m1.large vs. c3.xlarge), different
pricing models (reserved vs. on-demand), and different levels of
reliability (reserved vs. spot). Providing high performance at low
cost in AWS can be achieved by intelligently choosing what’s best for
the application(s) at hand. In this talk, I will present tips and
tricks for optimizing DevOps within AWS deployments.


The talk will focus on Yactraq, a video processing company, and how
they are cutting their costs by 65%+ on average using an approach that
leverages the spot instance market. Yactraq can’t choose the timing of
their spot instance use: their end-customer application facing
real-time APIs mean they MUST deliver constant performance, continuous
delivery at near 100% uptime and meet a performance SLA.

The capacity demand of the system is volatile as it not only depends
on the number of API calls from customers, but also the length and
quality of the videos being processed. Yactraq sees sudden surges of
demand that are as high as 70x typical demand. A priority for
Yactraq’s IT department is managing how high performance computing can
be balanced with costs and variations in demand.

Their solution now automatically applies AWS Spot strategies, keeping
costs down and performance up and dipping into reserved instances as
needed. After successfully processing more than 60-million seconds of
video,the solution has lowered the on-demand price for Yactraq by 80%,
compared to a 64% overall savings previously.
