**Abstract:**

“LEGOOps” ignite talk is a corollary to DevOps, including culture,
tools, community. The presentation goes through why implementing
automation on core services, establishing patterns, and leveraging
‘service management’ are all good ideas when looking to implement
DevOps within an existing company – especially an environment that
includes legacy infra solutions and is competing with newer methods to
deliver IT assets.

**Speaker:**


I’ve “salaried” in the IT industry for over 20 years, from help desk
duties to managing million dollar project budgets. My passions are
deeply anchored in culture, being a mentor, patterns-over-tools, and
people-to-process re-imagination. My journeys bring me across the best
technology disciplines with Fortune 100 companies working with
industry subject experts. Over the last eight years, my primary focus
has been to drive lighter-weight integration practices into end-to-end
automation delivery. I’m now in position to enable and empower
cultural revolution through engineering evangelism that emphases
collaboration, communication, and inclusion – all tenets of a DevOps
philosophy.
