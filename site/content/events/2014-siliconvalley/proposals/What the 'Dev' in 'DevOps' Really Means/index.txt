**Abstract:**

You won’t like it, but I’m going to tell you anyway.
 
Adopting agile development methodologies means more than just writing
really fast scripts. If DevOps is going to become a successful
operations methodology of its own accord, then ops is going to have to
start thinking about long term success and sustainability. In this
session we’re going to dig into what infrastructure as code really
means and why it’s imperative to recognize the importance of
infrastructure integration development as the future of DevOps.
