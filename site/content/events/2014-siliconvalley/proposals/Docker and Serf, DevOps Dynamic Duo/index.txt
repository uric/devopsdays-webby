**Abstract:**

Will describe how a financial entity can leverage devops to accelerate
service delivery. We're in the process of migrating our technology to
a technology stack based on Docker, Packer, and Serf. I cover some of
our key ah-ha moments from the experience such as:

* How serf enables teams to self provision services

* How embedding devops members into every single team improved
  communication and productivity

* How packer used in combination with docker with ops to provide a
  clear separation of responsibilities with simple tools

* How we were able to significant reduce the number of distinct
  technologies we needed to manage by adopting containers as the unit
  of deployment

Prior to docker, we were using a more traditional puppet system for
our infrastructure.  It had served us well, but was definitely showing
its age.  Introducing docker dramatically simplified our environment.
Where before puppet managed many different types of servers, we
converted almost everything to a docker container with a few runtime
tags to identify where things are.  Where provisioning of services was
done manually via puppet scripts on a per service basis, switching to
Serf enables teams to auto provision their own service.
