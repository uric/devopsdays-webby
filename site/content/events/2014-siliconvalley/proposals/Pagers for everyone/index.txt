**Abstract:**

It is really hard for non-engineers to understand what it is like to
be on-call. Often times, they feel as if we somehow 'work less',
especially when they see us come in late, unaware that we were hard at
work at 4am. Luckily, there is a solution to all this awkward
tension... put everyone on-call! We will talk about what it takes to
get the whole company on board, and how you can make that us-vs-them
gap a little bit smaller.

**Speaker:**

I'm Evan Gilman, an Operations Engineer at PagerDuty. I have a strong
network and security background, and was previously working in
academia.
