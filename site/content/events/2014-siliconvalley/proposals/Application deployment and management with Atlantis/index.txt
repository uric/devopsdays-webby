**Abstract:**

This talk will present Atlantis, a new Docker-based deployment system
which makes it easy to safely deploy applications in the cloud,
flexibly configure routing among multiple versions, and handle
dependencies among applications in multiple environments.

	
Deploys in any organization can be painful. Different engineering
teams use different, and sometimes subtly incompatible, scripts.
Leftovers from previous deploys can break new ones, or magically make
new ones work. Rolling back is poorly tested, painful, slow, and
sometimes just doesn’t work. Rolling out a feature that a new customer
needs may break older features another one relies on.

Virtual machines and containers make it easy to solve some of these
problems in the cloud, but are not the whole solution. Yes, you may
get isolated systems and that can be deployed independently and
quickly. But how do you know where to send traffic? How do apps talk
to each other? How do you make sure apps that shouldn’t talk to each
other don’t?

Enter Atlantis, a new Docker-based deploy and application management
system we've built at Ooyala. Running in a cloud or on raw hardware,
it uses Docker containers to split machines into single-application
partitions, then provides a custom router to intelligently determine
where to send traffic. Atlantis already has templates to build
containers for apps written in popular languages.

The router can flexibly direct HTTP traffic based on the request and
the applications deployed in Atlantis. Want to do a slow rollout? Just
add a rule to send a fraction of traffic for the application to the
new version. Want to route traffic to different versions of an app
based on the customer making the request? Sure, add a rule, and it’s
active nearly instantaneously.

Getting a new version of an app to production is easy. Build, deploy
and now it's now running in parallel with the old. Traffic can be
gradually moved over, and containers running the old version torn down
slowly until all traffic is on the new version. To roll back simply
send traffic back to the old containers.

That leaves only one small problem for most deployments. Maintain one
Atlantis cluster for staging, another for integration and yet another
for production? Well, you could use environments instead. Think of an
environment is a set of ‘sandboxed’ applications talking to each
other, with a little plumbing magic sprinkled on top. Environments are
cheap, in fact any developer who likes to test-by-deploying can have
his own!

We will also briefly cover other related topics, including security
and scaling.
