**Abstract:**

(Could also be an ignite talk)

In developing Atlantis, we have provided our various engineering
teams, with the ability to seamlessly configure and manage deployments
of their applications. With containerization and flexible routing,
understanding the impact and scale of an application is now shared
with the application development teams.

Teams can now easily spin up new versions of their apps in production
along side existing versions. This means that we can move traffic over
gradually which allows us to speedily adjust if things do not perform
as expected.

The traditional Operations role of managing systems over which we have
no control is now reduced, allowing us to spend time on scaling,
tooling and building out infrastructure to handle our next generation
products.

Product Engineers are now able to see how their applications work and
are managed in real world scenarios. The time and effort is now
devoted to creating new product and working in partnership with
DevOps. This partnership is vital, removing the "us and them” culture
of traditional Operations and Engineering organizations, and enabling
a faster more accurate time to delivery.

Atlantis is a fully container based deployment system. Applications
are now safely deployed, routing for multiple versions is handled
flexibly, and teams can easily see and manage their dependencies, even
in multiple environments.
