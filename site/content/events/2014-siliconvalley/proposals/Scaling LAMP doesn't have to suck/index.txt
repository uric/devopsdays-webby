**Abstract:**

I went from sleeping in front of my laptop everynight, rolling over to
restart Apache at 3AM, to automagically scaling servers from my phone.
Learn the harsh realities of scaling a web app (hint: your code
doesn't matter) in this fast paced talk as you walk through scaling
best practices for each layer of the stack.

**Speaker:**

Steve Corona is the Head of API at Life360 (800m API calls/day) and
was the CTO of Twitpic. He's written "Scaling PHP Applications"
(http://scalingphpbook.com) and blogs about life hacking and dropping
out of college at http://stevecorona.com. Steve lives in San
Francisco, CA.
