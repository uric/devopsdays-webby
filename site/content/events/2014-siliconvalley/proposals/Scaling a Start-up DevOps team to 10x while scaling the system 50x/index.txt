title: "Scaling a Start-up DevOps team to 10x while scaling the system 50x"
email: stefan@sumologic.com

**Abstract:**

Sumo Logic has built a strong DevOps culture. All our back-end
developers are on the on-call rotation, taking responsibility for
running the system 24/7 and rolling out new code multiple times a
week. This talk is about how we successfully grew that culture. The
lessons learned, things that worked, things that didn’t. How our
culture has evolved.

**Speaker:**

Stefan Zier is the Chief Architect at Sumo Logic. He enjoys building
and running large distributed systems. He is also one of the key
influencers for Sumo Logic’s DevOps culture. Prior to Sumo Logic,
Stefan was a key contributor to several products at ArcSight (now HP).
