title: "Programming Proxies to Do What We Need So We Don't Have to Talk to the Network Guys Again"
email: L.MacVittie@F5.com
---

**Abstract:**

This session will briefly explore what proxies are (and why they’re
necessary to emerging application architectures) before diving into
the need for programmable proxies. We’ll explore DevOps patterns that
leverage programmable proxies to support canary deployments, A/B
testing, and real-time application traffic replication.
