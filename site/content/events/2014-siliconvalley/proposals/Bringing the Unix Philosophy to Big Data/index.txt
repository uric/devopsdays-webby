title: "Bringing the Unix Philosophy to Big Data"

**Abstract:**

Nearly 40 years ago, the Unix philosophy fundamentally changed the way
we think of computing systems: instead of a sealed monolith, the
system became a collection of small, easily understood programs that
could be quickly connected in novel and ad hoc ways. Today, big data
looks much like the operating systems landscape in the pre-Unix 1960s:
complicated frameworks surrounded by a priesthood that must manage and
protect a fragile system.

Today, new technologies, like the convergence of compute and storage,
are bringing the Unix philosophy to big data, allowing tools like
grep, awk and sed to be used in map-reduce fashion on arbitrary
amounts of data. I'll describe both the design challenges in building
an object store that features in situ compute and what these new
technologies mean for the future of big data.

**Speaker:**

Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide
development of the SmartOS and SmartDataCenter platforms, and the
Node.js platform. Prior to joining Joyent, Bryan served as a
Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he spent over a
decade working on system software, from the guts of the kernel to
client-code on the browser. In particular, he co-designed and
implemented DTrace, a facility for dynamic instrumentation of
production systems that won the Wall Street Journal's top Technology
Innovation Award in 2006 and the USENIX Software Tools User Group
Award in 2008. Bryan also co-founded the Fishworks group at Sun, where
he designed and implemented the DTrace-based analytics facility for
the Sun Storage 7000 series of appliances.
