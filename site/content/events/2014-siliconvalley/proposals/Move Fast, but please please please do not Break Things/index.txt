**Abstract:**

At PagerDuty, we are building out a service that our customers rely on
being up 100% of the time. We do not believe in outage windows or
scheduled maintenance, so how do you manage change while still moving
fast and innovating? For us, it has been a balancing act of figuring
out what are the right tools to use, how much process to force on our
engineers, and how to keep updating these processes. In this talk, we
will go through some of our processes that we follow to make sure that
we foster a culture of moving fast, but not breaking everything.

**Speaker:**

Arup Chakrabarti Operations Engineering, PagerDuty
