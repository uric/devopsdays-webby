title: "Node.js: Reflections on Five Years in Production"

---

**Abstract:**

This year marks Node.js' fifth year - half a decade of "riding the
unicorn," as I've referred to it in the past. Joyent is not only the
corporate steward of Node.js, but also one of its earliest adopters,
giving me a totally unique perspective on its growth and role in
modern applications over the past five years. We deployed
Node.js-based services in production starting five years ago and have
worked extensively with a number of other organizations running
Node.js in production, such as Yahoo and ADP.

In this presentation, I'll take the audience through the Node.js
odyssey thus far, touching on the victories as well as the challenges
and battle scars earned along the way. I'll also discuss how our
experiences using Node.js at Joyent have deeply informed our
stewardship of the project. Five years later, Node.js is still
growing, and it remains the right tool for so many of our jobs. I'll
outline best practices for developing and deploying Node.js-based
systems, and take a look at what the future holds for Node.js in
production.


**Speaker:**

Bryan Cantrill is the CTO at Joyent, where he oversees worldwide
development of the SmartOS and SmartDataCenter platforms, and the
Node.js platform. Prior to joining Joyent, Bryan served as a
Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, where he spent over a
decade working on system software, from the guts of the kernel to
client-code on the browser. In particular, he co-designed and
implemented DTrace, a facility for dynamic instrumentation of
production systems that won the Wall Street Journal's top Technology
Innovation Award in 2006 and the USENIX Software Tools User Group
Award in 2008. Bryan also co-founded the Fishworks group at Sun, where
he designed and implemented the DTrace-based analytics facility for
the Sun Storage 7000 series of appliances.
