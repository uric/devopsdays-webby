**Abstract:**

This proposed talk is to serve as a reminder that DevOps is about
breaking down the walls between Dev, Ops, and QA. Despite not being in
the name, it is essential to include QA in the conversation within a
DevOps organization and work cycle. As the DevOps community has
matured, more and more attention is given to programmatic machine and
network configuration, and it is time to do the same for the many
tasks of QA.

This talk will highlight how QA is important and relevant to DevOps,
outlining the new roles of QA such as the necessity of automated
testing, but allay fears of QA professionals being rendered obsolete.
I will also discuss tools and programming concepts (such as the Page
Object Model) which can be applied to improve communication between QA
and Devs/Ops.

**Speaker:**

Jonah Stiennon is a Software Developer at Sauce Labs on the Ecosystem
and Integrations team. Sauce Labs provides a cloud hosted Selenium
Testing API, which allows developers to run Functional tests against
websites and mobile devices, in parallel across a large number of
platforms. The Ecosystem is team made up of developers whose
responsibility is to create/maintain open source projects which people
use to run tests through Sauce Labs. Most recently he has been working
on Appium, an open source project equivalent to Selenium that allows
for simulating user interaction with iOS and Android devices.
