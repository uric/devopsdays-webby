title: "Pro's Only: Shedding the Cowboy Image of DevOps, or How We're Crushing It At Rackspace"
email: gdusbabek@gmail.com
---

**Abstract:**

The DevOps mentality has historically been about bending or even
forgetting the rules while developers take on operations roles (or
vice versa) in the name of Getting Things Done. This cavalier approach
may work in some environments but in situations where technical debt
is measured in terms of years, corners cannot be cut. Even with
enforced processes there can still be agility; quality software can
still be developed, iterated, and delivered quickly.

Some teams at Rackspace are practicing "slipperly deployment." Code is
pushed to production several times a day. Operations engineers and
software engineers sit on the same teams, often next to each other,
and all review each others code. For us, the process is what allows us
to move quickly and freely.

In this presentation, you will learn about:

* the tools we have adopted or in some cases made,
* the processes we follow,
* and how we structure our teams

Properly executing along these dimensions allows us to deliver quality
software in reasonable time.
