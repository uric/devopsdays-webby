**Abstract:**

Operating online games is fun and challenging. Games are some of the
spikiest workloads around, and real-time really means *real-time*.
Randy will share many of the DevOps techniques he has put into
practice at KIXEYE: autonomous teams, micro-services, configuration
automation, a common service "chassis", and, of course, "you build it,
you run it"!

Because the DevOps worldview is as applicable to large organizations
as it is to small startups, he will further share war stories from
building, maintaining, enhancing, and operating eBay’s search
infrastructure and Google’s App Engine PaaS, each of which has
strongly informed the approach at KIXEYE.

**Speaker:**

Randy Shoup is the Chief Technology Officer at KIXEYE, making awesome
games scalabler and reliabler. Previously, he was Director of
Engineering at Google, leading several teams building Google App
Engine, the world's largest Platform as a Service. Prior to Google, he
spent 6 1/2 years as Chief Engineer at eBay, building several
successive generations of eBay's real-time search engine.

Randy speaks regularly at conferences on distributed computing and
large-scale infrastructure, and is particularly interested in how
organizations move rapidly at scale.
