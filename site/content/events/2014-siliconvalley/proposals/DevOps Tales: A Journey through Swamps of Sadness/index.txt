**Abstract:**

Another corollary around DevOps that includes analogical references to
movies like ‘The NeverEnding Story’, ‘ Raiders of the Lost Ark’, and
‘Empire Strikes Back’.

This presentation roots back to days long ago, when things were done
that are similar to current DevOps philosophies, challenges that
non-‘DevOps’ engineers/sysadms/technologists can expect (and those are
all ok!), and ideas to ponder from Yoda

**Speaker:**
