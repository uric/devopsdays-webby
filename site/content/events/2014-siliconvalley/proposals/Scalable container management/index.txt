**Abstract:**

Linux containers are exploding in popularity especially among
developers and in many ways are becoming the new virtual machine. But
like we saw with virtual machines, without proper management and
instrumentation we could end up with sprawl and inefficiencies. To
take full advantage of the developmental and operational benefits of
Docker and LXC, many systems automation tools now include support for
the oversight and management of containers to allow containers to
scale in large deployments.

This talk will discuss the merits of both image and configuration
management and how they can be better together. The talk will also
demonstrate management of Docker and LXC containers across multiple
physical servers including starting, stopping, freezing, cloning and
creating new containers. Because containerization at scale is good for
everybody.

**Speaker:**

Mike Place is a member of the SaltStack core development team from
Salt Lake City, Utah. He's been involved in Linux systems engineering
since the mid-90s and enjoys Python programming and running and hiking
in the mountains of Utah.
