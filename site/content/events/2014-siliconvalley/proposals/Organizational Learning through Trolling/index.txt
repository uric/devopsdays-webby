**Abstract:**

Learning, from both an individual and organizational perspective, is
one of the pillars of DevOps; there are unorthodox changes to team and
culture that can move your organization forward. At first pass, this
may seem like it requires classroom settings, formal structure (trust
falls), and frameworks for learning. Those things may all work, but
the heart of organizational learning and problem solving become part
of your team’s culture by constantly striving for new ways to look at
problems -- including trying to come up with the worst solutions
possible to problems, playing devil’s advocate, and sometimes delaying
decisions until absolutely required. In other words, you can build a
learning culture by trolling your team, and expecting to be trolled.


Techniques discussed in this presentation will apply to teams of all
sizes, both from the startup and enterprise world. You can start with
a bottom-up approach for improvement and learning; even if you’re not
doing rockstar-ninja automation and deploying 23 ½ times a day. This
talk will not focus on tools, but rather procedural and cultural
improvements that can make your team better.
