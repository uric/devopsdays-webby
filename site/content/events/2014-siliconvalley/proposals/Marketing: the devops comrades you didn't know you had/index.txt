**Abstract:**

Theme - How to get the business involved in devops

Development teams and sale/marketing teams aren't always BFFs. Too
often, there is a master-slave relationship: either marketing dictates
what the product team builds based solely on what is "sellable" with
little consideration to timelines or what non-customer-facing work
needs to be done, or the product team does a bunch of random work with
little consideration for creating a strong marketing "story". But it
doesn't have to be this way.

In the DevOps spirit of cross-team collaboration, why not recruit
sales and marketing as your newest allies in the fight against
workplace silos?

This talk will cover practical and battle-tested ways to work together
towards a higher-quality and more marketable piece of software. From
semi-obvious things like information radiators, to deeper
collaborations in roadmapping and release planning, there's a lot more
you can do than just invite the sales team to your stand-ups.
