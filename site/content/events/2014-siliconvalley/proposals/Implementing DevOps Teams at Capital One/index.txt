**Abstract:**

Discusses what worked and didn’t work for Capital One as they
implemented and supported DevOps Teams.

As large companies drive agile transformation, the need to have
dedicated people working on DevOps capabilities increases. Being
successful at implementing these best practices requires highly
technical resources as well as investments in tools and environments.
So in a large company where these resources are scarce and the DevOps
tools are not wide-spread, how do you implement these teams quickly
without breaking the bank?

This presentation will talk through the approach that was used at
Capital One which leveraged those limited DevOps experts and
technology to form a swat team to help jumpstart new DevOps teams in a
way that created a community of best practices and learnings. This
approach led teams getting formed quicker, improved velocity and
delivering value sooner, all while leadership got the visibility they
needed to ensure the teams had the support to be successful.
