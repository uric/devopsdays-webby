**Abstract:**

If you glance over the schedules of DevOps tracks at conferences, you
get the impression that the topic is mostly focused on running
large-scale web sites–but is that the truth? While we as a software
company provide a number of products, this session is not about what
we offer–it’s about how we managed to adopt a DevOps mentality across
our development, testing and operations teams. We talk about the
process of getting there, the challenges we encountered along the way,
and how we measure success.​

**Speaker:**

Wolfgang Gottesheim has several years of experience as a software
engineer and research assistant in the Java enterprise space.
Currently he contributes to the strategic development of the dynaTrace
enterprise solution as a Technology Strategy in the Compuware APM
division.
