**Abstract:**

Converting a B2B SaaS application into a multi-tenant platform is a
complex challenge. It requires sprinkling the code with the notion of
multi-tenancy. For example, the logo of each tenant is different and
one has to program the logo path to be dynamic rather than static.
This method typically costs development resources, pollutes the code,
lowers performance, and leads to bugs and rigidity in the code.

When faced with a similar challenge at Flux7 Labs, we took a DevOps
approach, with perspective across both functional areas to achieve the
best outcome for our clients. Our application was a complex Internet
of Things app built to monitor solar panels in the field and display
analytics in a web portal for a solar panel installer. Rather than
transforming our code to be multi-tenant, to handle multiple
installers, we built a multi-tenancy layer on top of the existing code
using Docker containers. In only two weeks, Docker helped us go from a
single-tenant app to a multi-tenant app with minimal resource cost.
This talk will describe our motivation, solution, and the lessons we
learned.
