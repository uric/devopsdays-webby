**Abstract:**

Panel Participants:
Evan Powell, CEO of StackStorm (moderator)
James Fryman, DevOps Engineer, GitHub (renowned DevOps guru)
Reinhardt Quelle, Operations Architect, Cisco Systems (big time figure in OpenStack and DevOps)
Patrick Hoolboom, StackStorm “Stormer” (DevOps unicorn)


Software is truly “eating the world,” and DevOps has changed the way
software is built and operated. There is a massive shift in IT,
brought on by the move to the cloud, towards a DevOps approach for
building and operating software, leading to an improvement in
productivity. By adopting this approach, organizations can experience
the same advancements currently being experienced by DevOps engineers
– a 10-100x increase in productivity. In this panel, industry DevOps
leaders will discuss how organizations can make the shift and embrace
the DevOps movement. They will discuss the technical and practical
limitations of DevOps adoption and the steps that need to be taken by
companies to make the transition.

Topics that the panel will explore include:
● What are the technical and practical limitations to DevOps adoption? Can you be “too”
DevOps?
● Is it possible to manage legacy infrastructure and apps in a DevOps friendly way?
● The pink sombrero, flying squirrels and other tips for DevOps and overall happiness?
● What is the state of the state? Do long convergence times imperil the notion that “the
state is in the repo?”
● Carrots vs sticks: encouragement vs dictates, experience in getting
adopted
