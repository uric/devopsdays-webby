**Abstract:**

At ulive.com, we run a realtime events system for ad-hoc log file
analysis and metrics. Immediate access to system and business data is
critical for our day to day operations. The first system we built
worked great for about six months, until we discovered intermittent
throughput issues and backlogging gremlins were plaguing this system.
Even worse, we were dropping log messages when our messaging rate
spiked. In this talk, Iâ€™ll tell a story about how we approached the
bottleneck issue, pinpointed holes in our architecture, and what we're
doing to fix it.

**Speaker:**

Mercedes Coyle is a Data Infrastructure Engineer with ulive.com.
