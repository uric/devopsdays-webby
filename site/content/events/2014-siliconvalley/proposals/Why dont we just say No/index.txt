**Abstract:**

Ask any Ops team, “What prevents you from getting your work done?”
Likely array of responses: Live issues, interruptions, conflicting
priorities, or shifting priorities. There is always too much work to
do.
 
This begs the question, why do people consistently take on more work
than they have capacity to do? Why don’t we just say no?
 
This talk will explore why Ops teams take on too much work, and why we
don’t hear agile development teams complaining about this topic as
much.
 
We’ll look at how one Ops team did reduce their excessive workload and
conclude with suggested experiments for improving the often absurd
imbalance between Ops teams demand and capacity.
