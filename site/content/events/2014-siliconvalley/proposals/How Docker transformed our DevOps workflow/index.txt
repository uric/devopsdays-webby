**Abstract:**

A number of inefficiencies exist in the software development workflow
at most companies. A major contributor is inconsistencies in different
environments as code moves from a developer's machine to build,
staging, and production environments. You hear frequent complaints
like - “ But it works on my machine”.

We moved to a Docker based process a few months ago, where Docker
containers are integrated into the development workflow right from the
time code is written on a developer’s machine to the time it is
deployed into production. As a result, we can avoid environment
conflicts, save on ops effort and costs, and ship features faster with
better quality.

We will present our tips and tricks on how to containerize your DevOps
workflow and ship features painlessly and often.
