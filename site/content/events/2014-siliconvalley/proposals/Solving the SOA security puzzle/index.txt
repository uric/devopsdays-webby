**Abstract:**

Let's face it - the security models from yesterday are simply not well
suited for a service oriented architecture. Unfortunately, the path
forward is not always clear. This only gets worse when your
infrastructure is cloud-based, possibly existing across many disparate
providers. In this session, we will discuss the best ways to secure
your SOA infrastructure, regardless of whether it is running on your
hardware or not.

**Speaker:**

I'm Evan Gilman, an Operations Engineer at PagerDuty. I have a strong
network and security background, and was previously working in
academia.
