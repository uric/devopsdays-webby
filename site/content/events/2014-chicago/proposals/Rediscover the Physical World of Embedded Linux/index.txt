title: "Rediscover the Physical World of Embedded Linux"
---

**Abstract**

With the expanding popularity of the cloud, saas and paas, engineers stopped paying attention to the world of embedded devices surrounding them. In that ignite talk I would like to share ideas of what I've built with RaspberryPI. It serves as a openvpn, tor hub and client, time capsule server, music streaming device, fitbit syncing daemon, ibeacon, dual wifi router, android backup manager, dhcp and avahi (mdns) server and more.
