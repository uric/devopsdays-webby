**Abstract**

The angle for the talk, and the message I am trying to get across, is leverage Continuous Delivery and DevOps not from a 'tech or process' perspective but rather how do we use the motivation to learn about our product faster to drive decisions. The talk covers natural items I strive for in environments - i.e. consistancy and predictability through environments - but from the perspective of not gold plating environments and how do you do this in an Agile team and not in a new silo.
