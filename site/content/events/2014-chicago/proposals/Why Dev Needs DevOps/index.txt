title: "Why Dev Needs DevOps"
---

**Abstract**

Some software application development purists feel that DevOps has possibly too much "ops" and not enough developer in it but XebiaLabs has a different perspective on this. Ultimately, developers want to get their apps released publicly so they can see how users respond and how well or poorly they perform. In this talk, I will talk about what is in it for dev, the challenges dev faces in a DevOps world and talk about how some companies have been able to take the dev pain out of the DevOps process.
