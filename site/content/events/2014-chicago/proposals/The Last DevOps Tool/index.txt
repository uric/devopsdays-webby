title: "The Last DevOps Tool"
---

**Abstract**

As a community we are consumed with tools. Tools that automate, tools that automate the automation. We discuss and write blog posts about the latest tool for X or why A is better than B.

Are we alone in this tool obsession? Do doctors discuss the merits of a new stethoscope on the market or talk about compassion for patients? Do musicians argue which guitar picks is better for shredding (hint: they do) or why Zeppelin will always beat Metallica in an awesome contest?

Let's explore the underlying causes of our tool-dominated culture and see if we can push beyond The DevOps Tool Talk.

Lovingly brought to you by a self-described toolsmith.
