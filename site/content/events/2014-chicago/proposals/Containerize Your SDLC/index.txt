**Abstract**

A number of inefficiencies exist in the software development workflow at most companies. A major contributor is inconsistency in different environments as code moves from a developer's machine to build, staging and production environments. You hear frequent complaints like - "But it works on my machine". Managing VMs in all these environments is also a tedious and complex task.

Using containers in your development workflow solves a lot of these problems, but the challenge is containerizing your workflow right from when the time code is written on a developer's machine to the time it is deployed into production.

I will present Shippable's tips and tricks on how to containerize your DevOps workflow. As a result, you can avoid environment conflicts, save on ops effort and costs, and ship features faster with better quality.
