**Abstract**

I have about 20 years of experience that has led me to want to move my career towards DevOps.  I plan to make this pretty personal, funny, lighthearted and use my resume to drive the talk.  At the end of the day, I plan to keep it pretty humble and more of statement of respect for the where the movement has come and how I see the thought leadership behind DevOps driving change.

I have the following outline so far.  I like the Ignite Talk format since I haven’t given a presentation of this nature for about 15 years and need a bit of a format to force me to edit/structure.  I also think I can probably come up with 20 original / entertaining slides.

* My early days as a Sys Admin
    * My very first job as a Sys Admin for an ISP in St. Charles called “Microthought”
        * I will probably have a couple fun nostalgic slides
            * Early FreeBSD and Modem Pools
            * Windows NT 3.51
    * I’m going to talk about my second Job where I worked with a bunch of really serious “Software Engineers” and how they were Sciencey and I was Musicy and when I found Web Development -- it wasn’t what they did and I liked it…
        * Basically, I could do development without being much of a Scientist..
* My move from being a Sys Admin to being a Web Developer
    * I never stopped doing Sys Admin work
    * I thought developers who couldn’t do Sys Admin work were lame
    * Don’t even get me started on the ones that couldn’t write SQL
    * More fun nostalgic AIS slides
* Application Support
    * How I was tricked into it
    * Why I’m glad I was
    * Why I think it’s precisely the “Dev” part of DevOps
    * For me, I’m going to talk a bit about how I felt some Silos broke down while I did my job at Apartments.
    * I’m also going to point out that some remained to rather inefficient ends.
* Management
    * What I like about management
    * What I don’t like about management
    * What parts of management I want to continue doing
    * I intend to try to make this funny
* 2014
    * Why are we still making configuration changes without Code ?
    * Why are deployments still hard ?
    * Why are developers still doing too much support ?
    * A few relavent RN things
