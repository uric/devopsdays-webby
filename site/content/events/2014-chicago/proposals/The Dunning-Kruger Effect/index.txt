title: '"If Only They Knew" - The Dunning-Kruger Effect'
---

**Abstract**

In 1999, Justin Kruger and David Dunning presented their seminal work on an area of psychology through a paper titled: "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments." The conclusions of their study became popularly referred to as the "Dunning-Kruger Effect" which is ironically often misunderstood and overstated. In this talk, you'll get a whirlwind tour of the original study, a fascinating tale or two, and why the results of the study should matter to you as a member of the software industry.
