title: "Rules of DevOops"

**Abstract**

While a single person may have the technical skills that it takes to be considered DevOps, one person cannot DevOps alone. DevOps is a mentality. It's a culture that has be adopted by your entire technical staff. There's no checklist of how to do this, because every organization is different. But while it's difficult to know how to do things right, it's much easier to point out when we're DevOopsing: doing DevOps wrong.

By recognizing our weak areas, we can work to improve them to move towards less pain and more glorious DevOpsing goodness. If you and your company are DevOopsing, gather round as we discuss the growing pains in adopting DevOps, both from a technical and cultural perspective. I'll use real-world examples from my own experiences in a company that is still working to achieve the DevOps holy grail.
