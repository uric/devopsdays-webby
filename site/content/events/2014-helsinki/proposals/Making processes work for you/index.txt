How to find right balance between bureaucracy and total liberalism in software development? There are many important software development processes, quality checks and tools that projects must remember to have in place to produce high quality software with high speed. Too often these things are forgotten as projects are proceeding in hurry or there are no possibilities to invest in those. Companies that are big and donâ€™t have tight limits in investments might build too heavy processes and cause too much bureaucracy and delay software development that way. It is important that the balance is right to optimize the process. The presentation will also cover some examples of well set up release models and tool setups including continuous integration and also tips what should be avoided.
