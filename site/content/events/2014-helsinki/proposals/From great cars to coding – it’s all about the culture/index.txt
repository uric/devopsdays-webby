Julius Manni is Vice President in IT at If P&C Insurance. He is passionate about driving for the strategic fusion of technology and business, and has proven track record in implementing agile business development culture in large scale inside "established" corporate structures. Before joining If in 2008, he worked in the IT Strategy practice of Accenture. If all else fails, as a personal insurance strategy Julius keeps a 'Plan-B' up his sleeve to become a full-time street musician.
