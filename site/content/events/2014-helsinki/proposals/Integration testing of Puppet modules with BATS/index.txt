title: Integration testing of Puppet modules with BATS
---
This presentation describes an approach for creating integration tests for 
Puppet modules with the help of BATS (Bash Automated Testing System), which 
supports TAP (Test Anything Protocol). Examples are given of how to write the 
tests, what are the pitfalls, and how to present test report. It also discusses 
techniques of reusing integration tests as a monitoring tool for production 
systems.
