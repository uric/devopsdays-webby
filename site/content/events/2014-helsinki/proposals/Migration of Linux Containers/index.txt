title: Migration of Linux Containers
---
Linux containers have been in the news a lot recently as a convenient
deployment mechanism for apps in the cloud. In this talk I will cover
work that Canonical is doing to enable container checkpoint/restore,
and ultimately migration across hosts. Under the hood, migration is
done using a tool called CRIU, which can dump and restore entire Linux
process trees. Since containers "just" Linux process trees with a few
control groups and some namespaces, we can use this tool to migrate
them. I will also do a demo of our current container migration
capabilities.
