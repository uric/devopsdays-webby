title: Riemann and Statsd sitting in a tree
---
Monitoring our systems is a problem that is not yet solved. That is
why initiatives like Monitoring Sucks [1] exist.

Riemann [2] is a a very powerful monitoring system that helps us
monitor our distributed systems. With riemann we can use a powerful
stream processing language to analyze our metrics and send emails,
track metrics, combine statistics, etc.

But switching to riemann is not easy if you have a statsd/graphite
monitoring architecture in place. You would need to send all your
metrics to riemann instead of statsd and this takes some time to
change.

In this talk I will give an introduction to riemann and show how you
can set it up without changing your existent statsd/graphite
architecture. You can continue to send metrics to statsd and they will
be processed by riemann so your #monituringsucks less.

backend/devops engineer at wimdu.com, where we have some very
interesting problems to solve. I write about software at https://simao.io/blog.
