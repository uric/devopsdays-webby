title: Enterprise flight into DevOps space
---
Enterprise adoption of DevOps is something that is already happening, but like 
with other trendy methodologies it happens quite differently with different 
level of success. This presentation accumulates speaker's experience in helping 
different size organizations to implement DevOps initiatives and gives 
interesting real life examples: war stories, jokes, myths. 

During last years we accumulated a lot of experience helping our clients 
automating their JVM projects starting from automated deployments and ending 
with fully automated production infrastructure configuration. 

Andrey Adamovich is a software craftsman with many years of experience in 
different lifecycle phases of software creation. Andrey's love is JVM ecosystem. 
In recent years, he tries to apply JVM goodness and Puppet ecosystem to DevOps 
initiatives his company is implementing for several clients.  He is one of the 
authors of Groovy 2 Cookbook as well as frequent speaker at local communities 
and conferences.
