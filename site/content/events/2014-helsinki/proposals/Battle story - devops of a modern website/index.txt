What things must change when you choose to run your business in the cloud? Getting new features into production faster. New types of business risks. Possibilities with automation (=infrastructure as code and continuous deployment) and some words about autoscaling. Challenges in constantly changing environment. New types of security issues that must be handled. We donâ€™t have first hand experience of all issues but we have already some pretty good battle stories to tell.
