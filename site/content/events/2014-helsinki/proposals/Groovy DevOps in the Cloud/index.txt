title: Groovy DevOps in the Cloud
---
The presentation focuses on open-source Groovy/Java libraries that we have 
developed in order to solve our daily DevOps problems including SSH 
connectivity, cloud instance management, OS image management and integration 
testing of Puppet modules with the help of Groovy and Junit. In the beginning of 
the talk, attendees are introduced to DevOps principles and problems it is trying 
to solve. After that we dive into the journey we had to take and tools we've 
created to help us reuse JVM knowledge we already had in the team as well as 
integrate operations team into DevOps initiatives and move closer to complete 
infrastructure-as-code dream.  

This presentation was already given at Java Day Riga (2013), DevOpsDays 
Ljubljana (2014), DevConfu Jurmala (2014), Devoxx UK (2014).
