title: When the sh!t hits the fan - WebOps disaster survival guide
---
This is a talk about reliability and disasters - how to prepare for disasters and how to handle them. But moreover, this talk is about why disasters are an inherent and essential part of building a reliable service. We will explore what kind of culture we want to improve the reliability of our systems and make disaster handling better.

Avishai Ish-Shalom is a veteran operations engineer and a survivor of countless production skirmishes. As co-founder and CTO of Fewbytes he is consulting start-ups and enterprises to help build better systems and services.
