## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack
thereof.) We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in
any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other
online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the
discretion of the conference organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized
environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing
branded t-shirts.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop
venues and conference-related social events.
