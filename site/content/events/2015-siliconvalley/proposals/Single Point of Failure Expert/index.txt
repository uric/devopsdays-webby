title: "Single Point of Failure Expert"
---

**Abstract:**
Note: Presentation and I can do an Ignite as well

When you create or manage a complex system you tend to learn all the "gotchas", accumulate arcane knowledge and become the system wizard.
The desire to become an expert is natural. However, monopolizing knowledge can be unhealthy for you and dangerous for your employer.

In this talk I will help you learn how to recognize the early signs and stop yourself and your peers from becoming a single point of failure.
