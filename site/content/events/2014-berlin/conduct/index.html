##ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY

DevOpsDays is a working conference intended for professional networking and collaboration within the DevOps community. As a community we value each other for what we do, regardless of age, disabilities, gender, physical appearance, religion or sexual orientation.

At DevOpsDays Berlin we are dedicated to provide a safe and comfortable experience for anyone attending. We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the DevOpsDays Berlin in any form - neither at the conference itself nor at the social event. We reserve the right to deny entrance to or to eject from the conference (without a refund) anyone engaging in harassing or discriminating behaviour.

If you feel harassed or discriminated or witness discrimnative or harassing behaviour by one of the attendees (including speakers, sponsors and staff), please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their T-Shirts and will be happy to help attendees solving any issue they might run into. 

To sum it up:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Be excellent to one another</li>
    <li>What you think of as "non-harassing" or "non-discriminating" might be viewed differently by others. Just don't say it if you're not sure. </li>
    <li>Help people which are being harassed. Call for help if you cannot do this yourself.</li>
    <li>If you're feeling harassed or discriminated, inform others if you can.</li>
    <li>The conference staff is there to help you and is dedicated to provide a great experience for everyone attending DevOpsDays Berlin.</li>
</ul>
