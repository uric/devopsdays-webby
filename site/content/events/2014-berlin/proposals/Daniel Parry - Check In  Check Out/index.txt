title: "Check In, Check Out - Rapid change Infrastructure leaving no-one out in the cold at Booking.com"
---

**Abstract**

Over half a million accommodation properties worldwide rely on
Booking.com infrastructure to facilitate guest stays. Yet the challenges
of scalability and reliability have not hindered the rapid pace of
development and change of Booking's massive web and mobile presence.

In this talk, I will present the underlying infrastructure technologies
that have enabled hundreds of measurable and monitorable live traffic
impacting changes to be made on a daily basis. Alongside this will be
presented some of the technical innovations that have enabled scaling
for year-on-year growth every year for the last decade.

I will also cover how focusing relentlessly on the customer has helped
to bring development and operations together behind a common goal.
Finally, I will touch on how company culture permeates right through to
how we develop and deploy software as well as how we interact on a day
to day basis.
