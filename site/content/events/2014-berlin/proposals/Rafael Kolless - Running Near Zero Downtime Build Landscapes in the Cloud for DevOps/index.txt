title: "Running Near Zero Downtime Build Landscapes in the Cloud for DevOps"
---

**Abstract**

In the Development Build & Integrationtest Infrastructure HDI of SAP for the Hana Development very often a conflict is generated between the developer teams developing the Infrastructure tools necessary for central build landscapes and the developers using this infrastructure.
With this Infrastructure we invented a new “Green-Orange” concept which provides an interrupt less maintenance, development and failover concept using a combination of Chef automation and the Cloud Provider Monsoon who provides internal IaaS for SAP with Chef support.

Rafael shows the architecture setup of landscape in the cloud which satisfy DevOps and software developers as a customer.

In the panel key some ideas and solutions are shown and opened for a discussion

1)      Using Chef to provide production and development landscapes for DevOps and software developer customer

2)      Fast delivery of sandbox landscapes for DevOps simulating the production customer landscape with fencing to production development.

3)      Combining Monsoon IaaS cloud functions with Chef automation

4)      Description of the „Green-Orange” Concept for Continuous Delivery without test & development interruptions
