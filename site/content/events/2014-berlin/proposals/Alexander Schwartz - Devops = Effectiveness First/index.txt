title: "DevOps = Effectiveness First!"
---

**Abstract**

In this talk we explore in detail how efficiency and
effectiveness are related to DevOps and the traditional
separation of Development and Operations.

Companies are usually aiming for high efficiency and
predictability. This seems to make sense in the first place,
as no one wants to be inefficient, right? But wait a second,
the ask for efficiency might actually be a source for a
permanent conflict with the DevOps idea.

The focus on “synergy effects” and “good utilization” – which
is a focus on efficiency – is often one of the main
motivations for creating silos in the organisation, for the
classical separation between Dev and Ops. Quite often those
structures are neither effective nor efficient in the long
run.

On the other hand, with DevOps done right one can achieve a
high level of effectiveness: Horizontal scaling, that is,
increasing for a team their coverage of the value stream from
idea to production, brings naturally the focus on doing the
right thing for the customer. Furthermore, by improving the
efficiency of an effective process, DevOps can enable
companies to be ahead of their competitors.
