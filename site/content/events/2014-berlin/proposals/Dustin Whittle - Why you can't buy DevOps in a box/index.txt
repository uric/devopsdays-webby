---

**Abstract**

Companies will often believe they can buy their way out of technical debt without making any substantial changes. In this session we will discuss the importance of DevOps and give a framework for enabling cultural change inside your organization. We will discuss which approaches have worked for startups, and which make more sense for the enterprise. Each method requiring their own set of tools and processes. We will delve into how organizations large and small have experienced these changes, the challenges encountered along the way, and the light at the end of the tunnel.
