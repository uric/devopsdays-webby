title: "Datacenters and unreliable network conditions"
---

##Abstract

Sometimes the network infrastructures are not one of the common environments you
are used to work with. Think of swimming data centers, far away from the shore
serving a high demand of modern web applications to be used by passengers. How
do you maintain and operate an application stack like this if remote access can
break every minute and deployments become a nightmare? How does a datacenter
with an unreliable network connection works with cloud services? What are the
challenges from the DevOps perspective? Join us to learn how we use Docker,
Chef, AWS and friends in such a challenging business case.

##Speaker

Joern has been developing, debugging and designing software for more than ten
years. At kreuzwerker he is responsible for architecture, new technologies and
concepts. A computer science graduate, his professional interest is in the use
of functional programming languages and the architecture of distributed
applications. In his diverse projects he has gained solid experience with
operating systems (primarily Linux and Mac OS) and has created various databases
from different paradigms. He masters C, Ruby, Java, Erlang and a little JVM
LISP. He is thus as much at home in infrastructure and service clouds
(preferably AWS) as on the command line.
