title: "ChatOps: Practices, Patterns, and Antipatterns"
---

**Abstract**

One way to think of ChatOps is as another type of user-interface to your
current ops toolset. It can be similar to existing command line syntax, but to
take full advantage of "conversation driven development" there are some
important differences. PagerDuty recently went through the process of creating
or extending dozens of services to be chat-driven, and learned many lessons
about how humans prefer to work with their robot minions. (Examples include:
accuracy vs responsiveness of a reply, when should a reply be public vs
private, and avoiding "information overload" on long-running or noisy
commands).

In this talk, we'll cover how plugins differ between several of the major chat
frameworks, go over what tools are available to make plugin development easier,
and go over UI patterns and conventions PagerDuty has standardized on when we
add features to our 'bot.
