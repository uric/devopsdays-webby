title: "Convincing the boss to DevOps!"
---

**Abstract:**

Want to deliver application the DevOps way? Your biggest challenge may
be convincing your bosses that DevOps is right for you, for them, and
for the business. In this 5-minute Ignite presentation based
independent data and many years selling new projects to executive
buyers, I will explain who to talk with to get support for DevOps, why
they will care, what they want to hear, the outcomes they need to see,
and how to respond to their objections.

**Speaker:**

Andi Mann, CA Technologies
