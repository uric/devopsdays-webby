title: "The DevOps Maturity Curve - where are you on it?"
---

**Abstract**

While DevOps as an application delivery paradigm is already reality in young startup companies and the big internet platforms like Facebook, Amazone and eBay, it poses significant challenges to large enterprises of other branches with a long IT tradition. To transform structures, which were grown over decades, so they fit into the requirements of modern IT in terms of agility, speed and quality, there are many critical factors. How does this journey looks like and what experiences and successes had companies on their way to DevOps?
