title: "Unit Testing for DevOps"
---

**Abstract**

With more and more developer best practices moving into
operations, the best practice of unit testing has not been
explored to it's full potential in operations.

After making changes to the operational setup of a site, by
changing configurations or adding new systems, it is unclear
if the system still works in the way it is designed.

Having a suite of unit tests can clearly determine if the system
is working, e.g. the search microservice, web login or writing to a
database.

In a critical situation the unit test suite also helps - just as with a
bug in programming -  to determine the root cause faster.

The talk gives an introduction to the concept of unit testing live
setups and gives some examples how to write and use such
unit tests.

**Speaker**

Stephan has been programming since over 30 years. He
filled several development roles e.g. managing development
of the pricing engine at ImmobilienScout24. With his last
role as CTO of brands4friends / eBay Inc. he got deeply into site
operations, though he is new to the DevOps scene.
