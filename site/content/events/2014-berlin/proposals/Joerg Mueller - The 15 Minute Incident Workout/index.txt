title: "The 15 Minute Incident Workout
---

**abstract**
Incidents in software operations cannot be prevented. This is why we put
responsiveness over prevention. In an ideal world we would all use tools like
the Netflix Simian Army that puts your operations in a constant failure
situation, which keeps everybody in perfect shape for incidents. In a less
ideal world it is not easily possible to take down random parts of the
production infrastructure just to test the incident readiness.
But it is possible to get many of the benefits by a much simpler approach.
Just by coming together and discussing certain situations following a
specific set of questions. I call this the 15 minute incident workout. It
doesn’t get you to a world championship but it will keep you fit for daily
business.
