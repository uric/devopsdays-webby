**Abstract**

Sharing is one of most important aspects of DevOps. I want to talk about our approach of sharing production metrics with everyone in the company by putting up TV screens displaying nice dashboards in our Munich offices.

Iâ€™m going to give an overview of the requirements, involved tools like icinga, graphite, grafana and describe some of the challenges and (sometimes surprising) results.

**Speaker**

Thomas Falkenberg is a performance engineer and DevOps promoter who loves pretty dashboards and new ideas. He works at PAYBACK GmbH in Munich.
