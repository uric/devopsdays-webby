title: "Make it SOLID. Software Architecture for System Administrators"
---

**Abstract**

Starting with Chef or Puppet as a System Administrator will lead you to
a problem where you are not sure what's the best solution of a problem
in terms of software architecture. I will give you a brief overview of
general well known and battle tested software patterns, which also
applies to infrastructure management code. In addition, we'll also show
Antipatterns, and best practices.
