title: "Learn Puppet in 5min"

**Abstract**

I would like to propose a ignite talk on learning Puppet in 5". The
talk will feature no slides, but a short demo, exposing, quickly - and
clearly, how to use Puppet and learn its main features. This ignite
talk is based on several such "micro workshop" that I have
successfully delivered in the past (like during the Java Posse Roundup
2013).
