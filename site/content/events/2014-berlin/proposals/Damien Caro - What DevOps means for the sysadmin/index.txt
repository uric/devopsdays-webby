title: "What DevOps means for the sysadmin?"
---

**Abstract**

DevOps is indeed a really good way of operating todayâ€™s applications but what does it really means for the sysadmin? What needs to be learned, what needs to change in the way we manage systems and communicate, where is the starting point?
Based on the learnings from a project with a large European customer we will discuss the best practices learned and the issues encountered. We will also talk about the tools and languages used and the learning curves depending on which platforms is used.
We will illustrate our sessions with examples using the industry standard like Chef, Puppet or PowerShell targeting the different platforms like Windows and Linux.
