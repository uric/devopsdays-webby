title: "How Continuous Delivery impacts testing"
---

**Abstract**


Most teams introducing Continuous Delivery face problems such as "How
do we fit our 4-day QA phase into a daily release rhythm?"

The transition to a DevOps strategy and Continuous Delivery usually
requires a significant readjustment of the testing approach.

Alex shares stories from various companies he worked for, and
discusses different ideas on how to retrofit testing for frequent
releases. This includes adapting the rhythm of testing, test
techniques, scope of testing, and re-thinking the entire quality
assurance approach.

**Speaker**

Alex works as an Agile Coach for HERE, a Nokia business, in
Berlin. His journey in the IT industry started 20 years ago as a
programmer. Over the years he assumed many different roles (tech lead,
team lead, release manager, lean manager) in different companies and
organizations.

Alex main focus is to deliver value to production quickly, so he was
working on evangelizing and introducing Continuous Delivery, DevOps
and Agile Testing in enterprises. From 2008-2010 he was leading the
release management of the eBay company mobile.de in Germany, the
largest online market place for selling vehicles in Germany. In 2011
Alex joined HERE, a Nokia business, in Berlin/Germany, and was leading
a delivery team for three years, which is responsible for multiple
REST services hosted in the cloud.  In March 2014 he switched to the
role of an Agile Coach and Change Agent for HERE.
