title: "Our DevOps Journey at HERE/Nokia"
---

**Abstract**


Establishing a DevOps culture in a big enterprise is usually quite
a challenge.

At HERE, a Nokia business, the traditional separation between
development and operations is the primary model. However, during
the last years several teams had the chance to establish DevOps
for their products. Those teams have chosen different paths and
solutions, and they all have in common that they are perceived as
being successful. The DevOps model had been proven to support
their goals, and the business is very satisfied about product
quality and high delivery frequency.

In this talk we try to share insights from the journeys of those
pilot teams, covering the obstacles they dealt with, how they
increased their maturity, how the cloud helped and most important,
the cultural change that goes along with such a transition.

The talk concludes with a discussion of the different forces
related to the question if DevOps will be used at scale in future.
