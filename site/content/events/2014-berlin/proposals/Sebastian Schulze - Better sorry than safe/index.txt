**Abstract**

The larger your company is, the slower and tougher it it will get
to crawl along the chains of command. You'll spend your days
discovering long-lost parts of your infrastructure and deciding
wether you'll end up maintaining this particular component by
yourself or by being given the runaround and ending up mainting
the component anyways. If you think large and enterprisey
environments are the death to corporate punk rock: think again.

This talk won't be about mindsets, fences or silos. We won't be
searching for solutions but instead try to explore this topic
tongue in cheek â€“ so don't bring anything to write, but be
prepared to share your own story.

**Speaker**

Bascht is a freelance infrastructure developer, rubyist, python
sympathiser, and redditor based in cologne. His weapons of choice
include Puppet, Ansible, Packer and Consul and he's pretty quick
with animated GIFs as well. At his shared office in cologne he is
responsible for keeping the 25 % blocking minority for
non-apple-devices.
