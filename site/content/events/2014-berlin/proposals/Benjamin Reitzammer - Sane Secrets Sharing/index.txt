title: "Sane Secrets Sharing"
---

**Abstract:**

I want to present a simple yet fully functional way of sharing secrets in a team
and using them in a configuration management tool.
The approach builds on the Unix philosophy and combines multiple tools in an
easy way and should be applicable by any team with very small effort, yet still
provides reasonable security.

The procedure is used in production and has proven itself well for our team of
three involved people.

I'll demonstrate the approach in a format that's both Ignite-compatible and is
close to live-coding demos.
