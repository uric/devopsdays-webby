title: "The myth of the full stack developer strikes back"
---

**Abstract**

In this talk we want to debunk the common misunderstanding that DevOps is <a href='http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/04/15/how-devops-is-killing-the-developer'>"killing the developer"</a> or requires you to recruit "full-stack" people.
Our thesis is that the requirement to succeed with a DevOps culture is not to have/recruit people with a super-broad skillset.
Instead, we discuss the analogy of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills'>"T-shaped people"</a> - people with a very specialized skillset but broad collaboration capabilities with experts in other fields.
