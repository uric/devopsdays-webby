title: "Docker at Shopify"
---

**Abstract**

At Shopify, we've been working with Docker since January 2014.
As of this summer all Shopify store traffic (~200K RPM) is served
from Docker containers. This talk covers some of the challenges
we've had to deal with to deploy Docker:

- The datacenter operating system we're building towards to provide a
 PaaS within Shopify.
- What a Docker-powered PaaS means for our development and operations teams.
- Orchestrating and deploying 100s of containers across hosts.

Docker is still early in the adoption curve, and there aren't a lot of
people publicly talking about their experiences integrating it into their
environments. We would like to share how we're linking Docker into our
organization.

which is responsible for exploring and implementing new technologies

team has spent the majority of 2014 working on integrating Docker into the
Company's infrastructure, to run most of Shopify's core platform and the
surrounding apps.
