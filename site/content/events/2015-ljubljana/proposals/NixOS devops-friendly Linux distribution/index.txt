title: 'NixOS: devops-friendly Linux distribution'
---
**Abstract**

During the last few decades we have built many tools and layers on top
of each other to automate the way we configure and distribute software.

We'll explore NixOS, declarative Linux distribution that builds these
tools from ground up based on the primitive Nix language and revolutionary
approach to packaging and configuration Nix provides.

Further more, we'll take a step further and use NixOps tool to use Nix
language to describe deployments and how to provision them.

Doing so should give us one language and one tool for managing the whole
stack of: development, configuration and deployment.

**Speaker**

Domen Kožar is a NixOS core developer and a Python guru. He's been contracting for the last 7 years and stepped into the DevOps world in 2013.
