title: 'Define "work"'

**Abstract**

"Work" is an elusive term, especially in the context of software R&D. We imagine "work" as a pipeline of well defined tasks, each resulting in an artifact we can hand off to others for further "work" - until finally we have a complete product. This mental model, originating in factories and assembly lines, is pervasive as evident by the frequent use of the terms "production", "shipping", "delivery", etc. - has resulted in the classic departmental separation based on disciplines and working methodologies such as waterfall.
In this talk we will analyze our "work" and develop a mental model to aid us. We will explore this model and hopefully gain a better understanding of the DevOps view of working.  

**Speaker:**

Avishai is a veteran ops and a survivor of many prod skirmishes. Currently masquerading as the CTO of Fewbytes - a consulting company for Ops and architecture.
