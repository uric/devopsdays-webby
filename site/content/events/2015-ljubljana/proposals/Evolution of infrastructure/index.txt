**Abstract**

We'll make an overview of technologies used to build infrastructre and
methods to utilize it from the beginning of modern computing till now,
trying to recognize the repeating patterns and deduce the future based on
them. We'll make a statement that "more of the same" approach as offered by
cloud based VMs is lacking and explore alternatives that enable us to build
a single infrastructure that can satisfy any kind of demand.
