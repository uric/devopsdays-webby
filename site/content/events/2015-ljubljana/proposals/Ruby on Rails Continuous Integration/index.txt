title: "A Ruby on Rails Continuous Integration process using Github, Semaphore, CodeClimate and HipChat"

**Abstract**

When you work on applications that your clients are actively using, you want to be 100% sure you don't break something when deploying a new feature. In this talk we’ll demonstrate how we set up a Continuous Integration process for Ruby on Rails and JavaScript using a variety of hosted tools and services.

We’ve also implemented various other improvements like code quality monitoring and notification systems.

At the end, we’ll talk about how the “nag factor” and “shame factors” help you write better code.
