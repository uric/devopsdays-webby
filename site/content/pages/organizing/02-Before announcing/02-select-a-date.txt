title: Selecting a date
---
Now that you have assembled your team, the next step is choosing a date. We usually take the following into consideration to find a good date:

- avoid overlapping dates with other devopsdays, especially nearby. We want to spread the events out; think of it as loadbalancing. All devopsdays events with their dates scheduled will be shown on the front page of [devopsdays.org](http://www.devopsdays.org/).
- avoid overlap in dates with other important local events: with other events happening at the same time, your attendance rate might be affected negatively
- 'piggyback' after/before other events: it's a great way to get started, and as people might have traveled already, they can be potentially be interested in a pre or post event conference
- take a look at the [devops conferences and events calendar](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/calendar/) so as to avoid accidentally scheduling during a time it may be more challenging to get the speakers and sponsors you want.
- you cannot announce a date until you have two things: an agreement with a venue, and a way to handle money.
- look at a few two-day choices you can accept. When talking to a venue, you might find that they can accommodate you better during some parts of the week than others. Sometimes they may be fully booked a given week, but available the next.
- consider that if you schedule one or more day on a weekend, you are likely to see a significant drop-off of attendance on the weekend day(s). DevOps is part of people's work life, and the weekends are typically used for refreshing energy with family. We recommend choosing weekdays.
