Your budget is going to be refined and adjusted as you determine how many attendees you think you'll get and how much you're going to commit to spending up-front. You're not going to know all these numbers immediately, but it's valuable to start thinking about them as you're choosing a venue.

Categories to consider:

Income:

- Sponsors (could be up to 75% of your income, depending on sponsorship levels)
- Registrations (make sure to set this such that you're covering per-attendee costs)

Expenses:

- Venue for talks & open space discussions
- Internet for attendees
- Livestream/recording of talks
- Catering for breakfast/coffee breaks/lunches
- Evening event
- Insurance/taxes
- T-shirts/other swag
- Badges/lanyards
- Signage
- Speakers dinner
- Speaker gifts (small token)
