When you have some idea of when you want to run and how much you want to spend, you can start talking to potential venues.

Venue space considerations:

- A (big) room where everybody can sit comfortably and listen to the talks. This of course depends on the number of attendees you expect. We have done events with a minimum of 70 people - 400 people. Assess the numbers usually attending your best-attended local meetups; you might get 2-3x that.
- A number of break-out rooms for the afternoon sessions:
  - it's nice to be able to put the chairs in a circle for better discussions
  - you can be creative by splitting the big room in smaller rooms but in practice, separate rooms are less noisy
  - we usually go for a few smaller (10-20) and few bigger (20-40) rooms
  - it's helpful if the rooms are close to one another, making it easier to move between open space rooms.
  - you can still use the big room for sessions too
- Room to hang out: not everybody attends sessions, and some are more interested in the hallway track. If there is some room for the food or a quiet room that's a plus.
- Sponsor space: Gold sponsors (at a minimum) get a table to have a presence. Make sure they have a nice spot at the event (typically close to the food or hangout space).

Aside from having enough space, there are other things to consider:

- Is the venue easily reachable by public transit and/or does it have sufficient parking, depending on the transit options in your local area?
- Are there (affordable) hotel accomodations nearby? (Running the event in a hotel makes it easy for out-of-town guests.)
- Does the venue allow for catering by other parties, or what are the options for food?
- Does the venue have enough wifi/internet capacity, or can more be added? Attendees will likely expect it.
- Can the video be streamed with enough capacity (if livestreaming is an option)?

A final big space differentiator is the pricing: as the price of devopsdays ranges from free to pretty low, we can't afford to pay the big bucks there. We've gotten around this in the past by:

- looking for (free) innovation centers or educational venues (universities...)
- finding local companies that can act as a host with their facilities
- finding a host sponsor that is willing to pay for a venue for you

Don't overcommit on the number of people coming and don't do a pre-payment for the venue until you must. The same goes for food: it's always easier to add a few extra plates as opposed to having too much food ordered.

If you have some legal entity created for the event, have the details at hand (legal name, contact details, business number etc.). Some venues may require this information to put in a hold for your chosen date(s).
