title: Announce your event
---
Once you have a time and place, you can announce your event to the world! It's great if you've had a chance to open your CFP and registration, though those aren't essential to announce your dates.

__Website:__

- You'll add your dates to the map on the front page of the website, and your city's name to the header above the map. You'll update your year-city page with the location and dates.

__Twitter:__

Tweet with the hashtag __#devopsdays__ and if desired, set up a city-specific Twitter account such as @devopsdaysmsp. Your tweets will be included in the Twitter feed on devopsdays.org and we'll also retweet you.

__Google group:__

Announcements can be made on the official [devopsdays googlegroup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/devopsdays).
