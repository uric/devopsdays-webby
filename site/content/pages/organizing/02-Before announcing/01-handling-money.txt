title: Handling Money
---
Part of organizing the event is the handling of the money, which means official invoicing.
This will be needed for:

- invoicing sponsors and accepting their payments.
- accepting money from and sending official invoices to people that register
- paying suppliers like the venue, catering, T-shirts, etc.

You cannot announce a date until you know you have a way to handle money. Realizing too late that you cannot process money has led to rescheduled or canceled events in the past.

The way many events have handled this is to find a local company that is willing to handle these logistics. In some countries, a local company is the only way to handle taxes.

Depending on the size of the event, you might want to give them a Silver or Gold sponsorship in return. Make sure they understand they will need to generate invoices and accept/make payments with a fast turn-around.

If a local company is not an option, we've worked with a few companies in the past that are willing to help you for a small fee in return.

To make invoicing smooth, it helps to use that company's paypal account for registration (on eventbrite or equivalent) and to use paypal (or equivalent) buttons generated by them for sponsor packages.
