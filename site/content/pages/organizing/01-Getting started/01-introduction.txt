Congratulations! The fact that you have reached this page means you at least have an interest in spreading the devops love to the world.
Back in 2009 when we organized the first event, we were probably as excited as you are now. But we were also bit scared and full of questions:
how does this work? how do we get sponsors? what is the first thing we have to do?

Years later, we can offer some advice from our experiences. Even though every event is a bit unique in its own way, we've come to a more or less standard approach for organizing these events.
With this document we want to support you and make you feel at ease in organizing one yourself. Don't worry; we'll be there along the way!

We recommend that at least one person on your team attend another devopsdays first, and then get in touch with the [core organizers](/contact/) to tell us about where you'd like to organize your own!
