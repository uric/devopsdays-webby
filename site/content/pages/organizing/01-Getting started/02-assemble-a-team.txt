In the devops spirit of collaboration, find people in your region that want to help you run the next awesome event.

- Talk to people at your local devops or related community meetups.
- Tweet that you'd be interested in running one in your region. (Use the #devopsdays hashtag.)
- Post your interest on the devopsdays google group or local mailing lists
- [Email the global core organizers](mailto:info@devopsdays.org) and we'll try to connect you to other people in your region

You're going to want a few people from different organizations on your local organizing team, so you have a broader base of support and involvement from the community.
