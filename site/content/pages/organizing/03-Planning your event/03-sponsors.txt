Sponsor packages are decided upon by the local organizing team for a city. The global core team does not offer sponsor packages, so any sponsors will work directly with the devopsdays event(s) they'd like to sponsor. You can use the [examples in the template](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-template/sponsor/) to help you make your decisions. Here are some typical offerings:

- Host (cost of venue): if a company sponsors the venue/food they will be acknowledged as a Host sponsor. Their logo will be directly visible on the main event page. They also have the opportunity to do a pre/post event meetup that will get promoted. And of course they get the same benefits as Gold and Silver sponsors
- Gold (around 5000 Euro/USD): 6 included tickets + a 'promo' spot during talk intermissions + the ability to have a simple table/sponsor presence at the venue.
- Silver (around 3000 Euro/USD): 4 included tickets, sometimes half a table depending on the local event's choices, sometimes just a single shared swag table.
- Bronze (around 1000 Euro/USD): 2 included tickets, sometimes can leave stickers/flyers/etc in public spaces
- Media Sponsor: get logo on the site and acknowledgement on social media. Used for media outlets and other conferences that are interested in cross-promotion with you. Sometimes they'll provide giveaways; usually you will not ask them to provide cash.

We want to avoid the traditional high-priced model for sponsors. We believe that the more companies that sponsor, the better: it amplifies the ideas and shows that many companies subscribe to the devops idea. 

We believe the pricing is low compared to the value sponsors get compared to what other conferences are charging.
Also, you may want to refrain from deviations from the standard package. Exceptions take extra CPU cycles. Best to be avoided.

Other offerings might be:

- Companies sponsoring travel expenses of speakers
- A Lanyard sponsorship
- A drinkup sponsor
- A speakers dinner sponsor

As a reminder:

- we do NOT offer speaker slots in return for sponsorship, and we want to maintain a standard policy on the pricing.
- we do NOT ever sell contact details of attendees. you can share demographics in aggregate to give sponsors a feel for what kind of crowd will attend.
