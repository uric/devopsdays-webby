title: Setting your program

We recommend a __two day__ single-track program with the following structure:

1. talks in the morning: this follows the traditional format of a speaker or panel
  - There is usually an introduction of about 15 minutes at the beginning of the conference from the organizers
  - We find that talks of about 30 minutes have the right balance for content.
  - You'll want to let the Gold sponsors speak for a minute between the 30-minute talks as that gives presenters time to set up their laptops
  - allow for rest and discussion breaks
2. You may break for lunch before the Ignite talks if that works best for your schedule.
3. You'll have a set of several ignite talks: 5 minute talks with 20 slides that auto-advance ([More detail on Ignite format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/ignite-talks-format))
4. openspaces in the afternoon: a self-organizing part where everybody gets to propose a session ([More detail on OpenSpace Format](http://devopsdays.org/pages/open-space-format))

We provide a [sample schedule](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-template/program) in the event template.

You can usually draw on different sources to get speakers:

- the call for proposals
- ask on Twitter for people to retweet your CFP announcement
- reach out to local meetups and organizations
- contact desired speakers directly

A few words of advice:

- No sponsor should be able to buy their way into the program. The schedule should be decided by your local organizers.
- Usually you will receive more tools talks vs cultural talks. We believe it's important to keep the balance right.
- Tool talks should be at the conceptual level, not at the individual day-to-day level
- We prefer new speakers to come on board
- We prefer new content that was not presented yet (or was already recorded)
- Avoid inviting only prominent out-of-town speakers; we need to make sure that local content/ideas get picked up and spread to the community
