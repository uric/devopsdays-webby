title: Tickets and pricing

We want to ensure that anyone who's interested in attending a devopsdays is able to, and that price is not a barrier. So, you'll want to keep your prices relatively low compared to many industry conferences.

__Free registration__
Experience has taught us that 'free' events come with a cost:

- about 30-40% of the people 'grabbing' a free ticket don't show up in the end
- this makes it harder to plan logistically: how many people will actually show up?
- people who could have attended are left out because the event appears 'full'

__Minimal Cost__
Asking a minimal fee (covering about food cost for two days - about 100USD or 100 Euro) gives us the best of both worlds:

- The numbers are more accurate that way and more people feel happy about it. 
- The financial risk for venue/catering cost is spread

The downside is that this will require 'official' invoices:

- It requires time to create the invoices (although it's pretty much automated if you use <http://eventbrite.com>)
- It might cost some accounting time because of the administration 
- Speficially in the EU region:
  - if a EU company organizes an event in another country, it will have to request a Tax-ID in that other country. The costs of doing that would take a significant portion of the event money.
  - charges for the event needs to be in the currency of the country where the event will take place

Bottom line: if you want to charge a fee (which gives you better financial protection), make sure you have considered that in your handling of the money.

To encourage people to register early it's advised to offer discounted __early-bird__ registration.
