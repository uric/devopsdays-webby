title: Setting up registration
---

Once pricing has been decided you're ready to set up registration. We've had good experiences with <http://www.eventbrite.com> integrated with <http://paypal.com> payments. 
The paypal account for payment needs to be linked directly to the company that does the invoicing.

The core organizers will not run registration for you, but we can suggest things that will be useful to you in your registration process.

Specifically on eventbrite we usually:

- ask for employer name (optional) if people want it printed on their badge
- ask for Twitter handle (optional) to help attendees connect with one another
- ask for T-shirt sizes (make sure you offer more than S-M-L-XL "unisex")
- ask if they require an invoice; if yes ask more details like VAT number if needed
- ask if they are interested in attending the evening event on the first night

- disable the facebook integration
- some events choose to allow people to see who is coming (name, company - not email!)

- set up a sponsor/helper ticket which has a high price ($9999)
- create discount codes for sponsors/helpers/organizers and have them select the special ticket so you can keep track of regular attendees and sponsors/helpers/speakers free tickets.
- the main reason is that when the event is full, you still might want to register the sponsor/helper/speaker people.

Attendee email or direct-contact information should never be visible on the website or given out to vendors. We value privacy and anti-spam a lot!
