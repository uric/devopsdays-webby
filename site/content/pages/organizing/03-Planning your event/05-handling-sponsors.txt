title: Finding/Handling Sponsors
---
Sponsors pay the bills. You rely on them. So what can you do to find them and keep them satisfied?

- post the event on the devopsdays google group. We've informed previous sponsors to subscribe themselves to get information on new events. 
- post on Twitter and other social media 
- find local meetups/companies that can help you
- if you're looking for a contact of a specific company that sponsored before, ping the devopsdays core organizers to see if they can help.
- write a blog on the website to promote your event.

Sponsors will usually ask you the following; best to have this information ready.

- Projected number of attendees
- Industries/Companies represented (share only in aggregate)
- What they get with what level of sponsorship (refer to the sponsor page)
- If they can buy a speaker spot (NO, but they can submit a talk, ignite or openspace topic)
- If you provide a badge-scanning mechanism (no, we don't go that route)
- If they will have electricity & network at the venue
- If they can get a monitor (let them bring their own)
- Where to ship their stuff and pick it up (don't take responsibility and let them handle that directly with venue)
- What size of table they have? Find out from the venue and say it has to fit behind the one table
- Where their table will be located (produce a map and let them choose in the order they signed up)

From experience, we found that it helps to have a single local organizer act as the contact with the sponsors to track prospects, payment, and giving them discount codes.

When they sponsor they need to supply:

- a logo for the website
- a URL to link it to
- an email address of a contact you can reach
- the invoice details (including VAT in Europe)

In return you'll :

- put the logo online
- link it on the website
- send the official invoice
- once payment has been received, provide the registration discount code

On the registration page, have them select the special sponsor ticket with their discount.
Many of the sponsor contacts are traveling from event to event, you'll have to follow up with them a bit so they sign up their crew in time for your badge printing.
Make sure you make the invoices "due on receipt" so sponsors don't wait months to pay you.
Make sure they sponsor directly by check or by paypal; do not make it a special ticket type in eventbrite, or you'll have to wait for eventbrite to disperse funds after your event.
