- The core organizers want the devopsdays website to be a central reference for all content produced during your event.
  - Add links to each of your speakers' slides on your program page.  (You may have to remind some of them a couple of times!)
  - Submit the videos to the official devopsdays video archive, then link them on your program page. (Talk to the core team for access.)
- Surveying your attendees and blogging about the results is optional, but strongly recommended.
