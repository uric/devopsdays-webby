- The core team can be involved in the selection process of your talks if we ask to be.
- If any global core organizers are able to attend your event, offer them a free courtesy ticket.
- Consider giving back to the community.  See our <a href="/pages/organizing/charity/index.html">charity page</a> to get some ideas.
